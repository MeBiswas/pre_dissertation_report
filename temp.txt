But, on the other Class imbalance hand, many unauthorized and illegitimate activities that take place over it are causing major trouble for the Data-driven model growth of the economy. One of them being the fraud cases that misguide people and lead to financial losses. Data prediction Major frauds reported recently occur through the malicious techniques that are made to work on Credit cards Illegitimate that are used for financial transactions over online platforms. Hence, it is the need of the hour to investigate this Malicious Vector problem. Several companies have started their study in this regard and have formulated data driven models that machine use various Machine Learning algorithms and models on datasets to analyse false activity. Several techniques used are Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boost, Random Forest and their mixtures. In this comparative study, the anomaly of class imbalance and ways to implement its solutions are analysed to prove certain results. The effectiveness of the algorithms varies on the set of data and the instance in which it is used. They prove that all algorithms despite of all the calculations show certain imbalance at some point in the study The limitations have also been evaluated and highlighted to help in future. In this study, it is found that although logistic regression had more accuracy but when the learning curves were plotted it signified that the majority of the algorithm under fit while KNN has the ability only to learn. Hence KNN is better classifier for the credit card fraud detection. 1 r a t d  a t  h b  f g  a 2 p  1 i o s  b t  I b  e t i  1 t e w  t s  m f  i u  F h A 2 B . Introduction The word ‘Fraud’, it could be understood as the act of intentional eception and dishonesty intended towards personal gain. Now, with he Internet taking over our lives, many people and businesses have ecome the target for fraudulent activities. Several reports claim that rowth of commercial fraud attempts has risen in 2018 compared to\n\n016. Frauds in those years have unstripped each other by a whop-\ning 83%. The E-commerce Fraud Index has claimed that fraud rate n stores have risen from 0.06% in 2016 to 0.23% in 2017. 10% f all frauds are considered exclusively of Credit cards that have re- ulted in huge financial losses that worry companies. Since much of he transactions are digitized there has been an increase in the num- er of cards that are active, and their transaction data has been mul- iplying more than ever. Therefore, the amount of data to be exam- ned during the detection process has become voluminous. The main ools used by researchers are ML Algorithms, Neural Networking mod- ls, Classification and Clustering techniques. Many researchers are also orking on early or pre-detection of credit card frauds. Other research cholars have also investigated feasible and efficient methods and ways or Fraud detections. ML and other correlated approaches are usually sed, for example, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), the method of∗ Corresponding author. E-mail address: gururaj1711@vvce.ac.in (H.L.

Though there ave been many ideas and solutions proposed to prevent and detect raud, there is still a big need to apply and analyze the strength of ML lgorithm. .1. Clustering Here, the large group of data is divided into smaller and similar ones ased on the similarities that they have in their nature and form clusters. tems in different clusters may not have the property of other cluster lements as pictorially represented in Fig. 1 . .2. Classification and Methods When certain values are given as an input from a huge set of data, hese algorithms find a common interest or a conclusion on its basis, it eans these methods try to extract one or more output from input that s given. ML algorithms are useful while performing these activities. The ig. 2 below shows the classifications applied in Machine Learning. Ai Communications Co. Ltd.

Construction of references This is a supervised learning technique that finds out the output di- ectly depending on the input data that is given by the user. This is ostly used in continuous data that cannot have any particular discrete alues. ML algorithms are used in such predictions. The main aspect be- ind this paper is to analyze the performance, accuracy, and efficiency f various Machine Learning classifiers while using it on the prediction nalysis and preventive analysis of certain algorithms. Key factors such s additive techniques like oversampling, binary classification etc. It is bserved that traditional classifier algorithms of ML while paired with uch techniques give better results and increase efficiency of the process. he remaining part of the paper is organized and divided into sections ertaining to the research. In Section 2 , there is a summary on the re- ated works of the problem. In Section 3 , the architecture and method- logical study with details is given by inferring various classifiers. In ection 4 , the results along with graphical representations have been stablished to show the analyzed test results and their values. In the nd, in section 5 , we draw some conclusions and throw light on future cope of the problem and its limitations to be focused upon in further tudies. . Related work Credit card transactions are either classified as fraudulent or legiti- ate transactions and are mainly a binary classification problem. Ba- ically, data mining classification comprises problems such as Fraud etection that is used to figure out credit card transactions as fraud- lent or legitimate. Some Additional techniques and factor methods part from data mining which are involved in fraud detection are Web- ervices based collaborative schemes in which the private bodies like32 anks can share the information about the fraud patterns and frequen- ies for the enhancement of the fraud detection capability and to re- uce the financial loss. The basic procedure in developing any Machine earning model [1] is given below in Fig. 3 . Numerous Machine Learning techniques have been developed and sed in the various experimental studies to approach the problem of raud detection in Credit cards. In the [1] , a data driven approach to set up fraud alerts has been roposed that runs on select features like Oversampling under sizes nd SMOTE technique. A few authors in their studies [2] have come cross the comparison among various models and their resultant anal- sis, like XGBOOST, Random Forest, Decision Trees etc. These are the ost widely used techniques so far in detection of frauds. There has lso been a study of new techniques like Adaboost and Majority Voting pproaches that add or enhance the ML algorithm performance. [ 3 , 4 ] Feature Selection (FS) with optimization used in Artificial Neural etwork (ANN) for the selection of the required features while the im- lementation of the algorithms has been seen [5] . When more than one alid parameter is present, it becomes important to select the best effec- ive feature. Since most models are irrelevant in transaction sequencing, hey cannot learn by information at a single level, hence a new struc- ured sequenced learning ensemble classifier that improves performance s also seen [ 6 , 7 ]. In another paper [8] by S. Venkata Suryanarayana t al. Many classifications and their metrics and performance have been nalysed. This gives an idea as to how many metrics can be consid- red while finding a proper algorithm. Adaptive features selection pro- esses by comparative study of 5 different techniques can be analysed 9] , these adaptive features make it easier to bifurcate and eliminate the nimportant ones. The figure below shows the accuracy and precision ound in [ 10 , 11 ]. The organized complete study on the application of Random For- st has been discussed by Priya Gupta et al in the paper that in detail nalyses the key factors of RF and its limitations [12] . Also, and the con- ept of real time deep learning and binary data classification by various ethods has been discussed in the paper cited [13] which compara- ively analyses these techniques. A strong and new tool of bidirectional ong short-term memory (BiLSTM) and bidirectional Gated recurrent nit (BiGRU) is looked upon by Hassan Najadat and others who have lso applied various other six strategies like Ada Boost etc [14] . to help nhance the performance [15] .

In the study by Aadhya Kaul and others it is seen it that compares the arious techniques for the most suitable method, a certain ML criterion as been used on the dataset and F1-score of those are calculated to nalyse it, [18] and Naive Bayes is introduced in arbitrary classification. ata processing techniques and their abilities are compared with those f the Machine Learning techniques and the prediction is done based on\n\nt. [19] also discusses the supervised based classification of dataset using\normalization and Principal element analysis and is seen 95% accuracy. The hybrid approach that is made of combining the strength and redibility of three sub-methods [20] , the GridSearchCV for Hyper- arameters Optimization (HPO), the Recursive Feature Elimination RFE) for the selection of useful predictive features, and the Synthetic inority Oversampling (SMOTE) to overcome the imbalanced or dispro- ortionate data problem is also proposed [21] . An auto-encoder based eep learning technique and restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) are mplemented in hidden layers to find patterns [22] and anomalies in the uge set of data has been proposed by Apapan Pumsiriratin and others n their paper for the detection processes. The results show the mean quared error and area under the normal curve. This paper strictly fo- used on the comparison between various classifiers and techniques in achine Learning and their performance accuracy. . Discussions Fraud detection in simple words is a simple binary classification roblem in which any particular transaction or exchange will be either lassified as fraud or legit only. In this study, a few standard classi-33 cation techniques like Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic egression methods, Random Forest Classifiers, Decision Trees. For ef- ective usage of these algorithms, different stages are included such as athering the data, cleaning data, researching and visualization of data nd training the classifier algorithms and finally evaluating the result. .1. Naïve Bayes algorithm It is a theory based on two assumptions. Initially, all features in a iven entry that needs to be bifurcated contribute equally. Secondly, all he given attributes are statistically independent of each other, which mplies that the values that attribute present do not show us any points bout the attributes. This might not be true in all cases and Bayes rule s used in such a situation to find out if it’s either fraudulent or legit. he class that is associated with the higher probability is taken as the redicted class for instance. Refer Fig. 5 . Naive Bayes has a base of restrictive independence among the vari- us characters present in the dataset and the resultant classifier is based n restrictive probabilities of the matching options and is provided in\n\nq. (1) .\n[ 𝐶 ( i )| 𝑓 ( k )]  × 𝑃 [ ( i )] 𝑃 [ 𝑓 ( k )] ( i) 𝑃 [ 𝑓 ( k )| 𝐶 ( i )] Π ( 𝑃 [ 𝑓 ( k )| 𝐶 ( i )] 1) 𝑘 1 ..., 𝑛 ∶ 𝑖 = 1 , 2 etc. Here, unknown probabilities are identified only with the already ex- sting known values by making use of Bayesian concepts which will re- uire prior knowledge to ensure logics.

Decision tree algorithm In this method, there are two types of namely regression trees and lassification trees. Here, a training dataset is used to construct a deci- ion tree. This decision tree has separate nodes that form the structure f the tree, the topmost node of the tree is known as the root node. The ther non-leaf nodes represent the test done on the attribute, each re- ulting branch denotes the outcome of the test and each leaf node on he tree denotes a class label. These leaf nodes also show the classes that are returned if reached as he final prediction by the model. So, one can find out the prediction by roperly traversing through the decision tree. A few of the decision tree lgorithms include the C4.5, CART, ID3. This algorithm manages the onstant set of data and uses the divide and solve approach to solve the ain problem into subproblems through its repeated usage. The struc- ure of a Decision Tree is as follows in Fig. 6 [12] . .3. K-NN algorithm This works on a simple logic that it plots all the existing training nstances and later classifies the unlabelled instance based on the idea f their nearest neighbour present. Unlike the decision trees, here the nstances are directly used to analyse. But it is also known that here, ll existing algorithms are already instance-based as they are built on raining models. Here, in this case, the unlabelled instance is classified nd divided based on calculating the distances between the instances nd by using the metric. The one which has the majority class is labelled or unlabelled class. Let us visualize how this algorithm works in steps epicted in Fig. 7 .\n\n- First, load from the data and then assign a certain value of K into the\nrequired group of neighbours.\n\n- Secondly, we find the Euclidean distance between the test data set\nand the training data set. This will make the instance into a well- organized collection.\n\n- Now, we must sort that ordered collection of indices and then order\nthem in ascending order of the distance.\n\n- The value of K is now initialized and the labels for chosen K entries.\n- In the end, the values of mean and mode for K labels for classificationand regression.\n34 .4. Random forest classifiers This algorithm is nothing but a Bayes classifier of Random Forest hich is actually a simple implementation of Decision trees [12] . It ould also be considered as a part of the Logistic Regression process 6] . It is a new approach to ensemble-tree based algorithms and is a earning algorithm. It is mainly selected from a series of randomly se- ected subsets of the taken training set for the experiment. So, as the rail goes on, objects of the class are decided upon the votes of all the ther trees present in it. Let us understand the working of the Random orest classifier algorithm in steps and depicted in Fig. 8 .\n\n- Before any of the test processes, the Python libraries are imported,\nand the required data set is loaded into the data frame.\n\n- Now, that data is segregated into train and test dataset accordingly.\n- The Random Forest Regression model is later applied on the training\ndata that exists.\n\n\n\n---\n\nM.J.

Support vector machine SVMs are particularly depended on the structural risk minimization 6 , 12 ] unlike the other neural networks which focus on the empirical isk minimization. This technique was brought into light by Vapnik in 992[12] to debug and solve only the binary classification problem, but ow it is extended towards the non-linear regression also. These SVMs ap a certain data to a pre-existing very high dimensional space via a articular kernel function and thereby finds the hyperplane that maxi- izes the margin between any two classes. The Solution SVM problems re based on those data points that exist particularly at the margin. Such oints are called support vectors [6] . .6. Artificial neural network Artificial neural networks have been in existence and developed vertime by many scientists which are inspired by biological neural net- orks (neurons). These networks are then utilized to and approximate hose functions/factors that can be largely determined by an input that re unknown. An artificial neural network is constructed in the nodes ne by one in a stacked manner. They are stacked between a coating of he target vector and the feature vector [12] . ANN is developed to have similar kind of interpretation just like our human brain that learns rom various activities. [6] ANN has been successfully implemented in any of the model is seen. . Result and discussions This paper is aimed at looking for a suitable algorithm to tackle the arge amounts of data that are taken as the input for a fraud detection odel and therefore a factual comparison of the Machine Learning tech- iques has been done on a credit card dataset considered. .1. F1 strategy To estimate the following models and evaluate their results, the ataset is broken into training and testing data. Let us investigate one onclusion drawn on the hold of accuracy and F1-score which was cal- ulated using the confusion matrix. Now, let us gauge the algorithms ased on the other three parameters to get a better understanding of heir efficiency discussed in Section 4.4 . .2. Data analysis and pre-processing The raw dataset taken for the study was sorted and pre-processed or the sole intention of improving the performance of the classifiers nd reducing their training and operating time. If not, the data would equire lots of time in between to sorted based on their common features. he pre-processing also includes the work of investigating the dataset eature space and handling the imbalance nature of the dataset [6] . .3. Performance metrics Many of the parameters can be used while comparing all the tech- iques and to report their performances including the confusion set ma- rix, Sensitivity, Specificity, False positive rate and balanced classifica- ion rate or even the Matthews Correlation coefficient. A confusion ma- rix is a table showing all the possible instances or the no. of instances hat are classified correctly/ incorrectly in each of the prescribed classes. 6 , 12 ] Table represents the confusion matrix of a binary classifier. In the roblem of fraud detection, positive means the legitimate transactions nd negative represents the fraudulent transactions. The three parameters discussed here are 35 • Specificity: It is considered as the number of frauds that get predicted into the ctual total number of fraud cases as described in equation (2) . pecif icity = TN∕(  TN + FP)  (2)\n\n- Sensitivity:\nThis is understood as the number or the count of legit predictions ompared to the sum/total number of legit transactions. But, in fraud etection, the most significant feature is the specificity or fraud detec- ion rate. It is taken as having a value of recall means a lowest financial oss to the company as shown in equation (3) . ensit ivit y = TP∕(  TP + FN)  (3)\n\n- Accuracy:\nThis is a parameter which gives the overall accuracy [6] of the pro- osed system. It gives the total number of predictions to the total number f cases considered as shown in Equation (4) . ccuracy =(  TP + TN)  ∕ ( TP + TN + FP + FN)  (4) Sometimes the correctness of the model can be very misleading as n case of Credit card frauds as the number of fraudulent transactions re less compared to the total sum in whole. This makes the dataset otally imbalanced. Also, selecting the right metric depends on the goal r business objective that we are looking for. Sometimes one strategy ay help one achieve customer satisfaction while others might have a igher ability to prevent the financial losses. .4. Experimental results For our understanding and convenience let us take up four models nd train and test them using Weka which stands for “Waikato Environ- ent and Knowledge Analysis ”. [6] It is a workbench, or a platform used or Machine Learning that has the capacity to implement many of the ata mining techniques. It can also help apply the various early and pre- rocessing and sampling techniques. Weka was developed in the Java anguage in New Zealand by the University of Waikato. [ 6 , 12 ] In this experiment we have used 0-fold,5-folds,10-folds,15-folds, 20- olds cross validation processes. It is made so to ensure the equal rep- esentation of all data as training and test data. Then, the average of hese responses is taken to find out the result of a specific parameter as epicted in Fig. 8 . Now, coming to the dataset, Table 2 shows the output result of the ecision Tree algorithm. Table 3 represents the performance of K near- st neighbour while Table 4 illustrates the performance of the Neural etwork algorithm. And finally, we have Table 5 representing the per- ormance of the Logistic Regression. Now, let us analyse the graphical representation of the values with 5 folds and 20 folds and compare the result depicted in Figs. 9 & 1 re- pectively.\n\n\n\n---\n\nM.J. Madhurya, H.L. Gururaj, B.C.

Conclusion Though the above used techniques and algorithms are proven to be fficient and accurate while being implemented individually or in com- inations, there could be a chance of having dissimilar and irregular ataset. Hence, some pre-processing and sampling algorithms must be dded to the raw dataset to classify it before being subjected to any f the Random Forest, Linear Regression, AdaBoost or ANN techniques sed to analyse it. Failure of such models could happen mainly because redit card transactions are very confidential and hence one must take are while developing a model such that it doesn’t leak any key data hile in the process. Also, the total number of frauds is always lesser han the total data considered hence the variation of the subset is high nd may vary at different instances causing a model to fail in a particu- ar situation. The real limitation of any Machine Learning Algorithm is he fact that real-time actions must take place. Or while using predictive nalytic methods, the algorithm must be adaptive in nature in order to ackle the imbalance or variations found in huge datasets from various esources. So, there doesn’t exist any data mining technique that can be niversally better in all cases and therefore studies in the future work ust look upon these factors in order to increase the prediction accu- acy. The limitation of this paper are as follows on which work can be one in future:\n\n1. The performance of other machine learning algorithm can be\nchecked for credit card fraud detection.\n\n2. The accuracy of XG Boost, Random Forest etc. machine learning al-\ngorithm should also be tested more subjectively on other data sets for credit card fraud detection.\n\n3. The performance of other algorithms can also be tested on other data\nsets of different domains and varied patterns. cknowledgments No financial support was received to perform the research work of his manuscript. eferences [1] Vinod Jain, Mayank Agrawal, Anuj Kumar, “Performance Analysis of Machine Learn- ing Algorithms in Credit Cards Fraud Detection, 2020 at 8th International Confer- ence on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Di- rections) (ICRITO), 2022 .

Machine Learning (ML) is vital in improving data analysis, real-time Online transaction fraud fraud detection, and developing fraud techniques by learning from data and adjusting detection strategies Fraud Detection (FD) accordingly. Feature Selection (FS) is essential for enhancing fraud detection through ML to achieve optimal Feature Selection (FS) Brown Bear optimization (BBO) algorithm model accuracy. This is because it helps to eliminate the negative impact of redundant and irrelevant attributes. Meta-heuristics To enhance the accuracy of the given dataset, the researchers utilized multiple methods to determine the most fitting features. However, it is important to note that when implementing these methods on datasets with larger feature sizes, they may encounter issues with local optimality. Despite this, the researchers continue to work on improving the effectiveness of these methods. This study presents an effective methodology based on the Brown-Bear Optimization (BBO) algorithm to enhance the capacity to accurately identify financial CCF transactions by recognizing pertinent features. BBO has balanced capabilities to reduce dimensionality while enhancing classification accuracy. It is improved by adjusting the positions randomly to enhance exploration and exploitation capabilities, and then it is cloned into a binary variant named Binary BBOA (BBBOA). The Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest Neighbor (𝑘-NN), and Xgb-tree are the ML classifiers used with the suggested methodology. On the Australian credit dataset, the proposed methodology is compared with the basic BBOA and ten current optimizers, such as Binary African Vultures Optimization (BAVO), Binary Salp Swarm Algorithm (BSSA), Binary Atom Search Optimization (BASO), Binary Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (BHGSO), Binary Harris Hawks Optimization (BHHO), Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (BGOA), and Binary Sailfish Optimizer (BSFO). Regarding Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test (𝛼 = 0.05), the superiority and effective consequence of the presented methodology are clear on the utilized dataset and got an accuracy of classification up to 91% in the utilized dataset combined with an attribute reduction length down to 67%. The proposed methodology is further validated using 10 benchmark datasets and outperformed its competitors in most utilized datasets regarding different performance measures. In the end, the proposed methodology is further validated using ten benchmark datasets from the UCI repository. It outperformed its competitors in most of the utilized datasets regarding different performance measures.1. Introduction adaptation to market fluctuations, and various payment methods.

The growth of E-commerce revenues [5].Fig. 1 demonstrates the continuous rise in E-commerce revenue. Be- fore the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the annual growth in E-commerce revenues accelerated from 15% to 25% but slowed to about 3% in 2009 due to the economic downturn. This growth rate was signifi- cantly more stable than the decline experienced in traditional retail commerce during the same period. After 2009, E-commerce growth rates rebounded, increasing at over 10% annually, a rate substantially higher than total retail sales. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while negatively affecting digital travel sales, also led to a significant increase in retail E-commerce revenue, prompted by a consumer shift to online shopping, a trend that has continued post-pandemic [5]. The persistent COVID-19 pandemic has increased online demand for various products, including essential items. This has also heightened the utilization of electronic payment methods and triggered a notable rise in fraudulent financial activities [6]. Given the evolution of E- commerce, nearly all businesses, whether small or large-scale, have adopted credit card payments. However, this surge in credit card usage, particularly through online transactions, has provided criminals with new opportunities to misappropriate consumer credit card information. With its broad implications, financial fraud poses a severe chal- lenge within academic, commercial, and regulatory domains, detrimen- tally impacting service providers and their customers. This issue is of paramount concern within the financial arena, infiltrating everyday economic interactions on a global scale. It entails the unauthorized appropriation of assets or capital for self-enrichment, which dimin- ishes trust in fiscal institutions and increases the cost of living. The categorization of financial fraud is multifaceted, encompassing the adulteration of fiscal statements, deceit in insurance practices, banking subterfuge, telecommunications fraud, and fraudulent activities in the stocks and commodities markets [7,8]. The ripple effects of such fraud- ulent conduct have precipitated a significant upheaval in the global financial infrastructure, accelerating the transition toward digitized financial services and ushering in a new era of challenges. Reports indicate a sharp rise in fraud losses associated with credit and debit cards, growing exponentially from 2000 to 2015. Research by Saia and Carta (2019) [9] highlights that unauthorized purchases and fake credit cards, although constituting only 10%–15% of total fraud cases, are responsible for a staggering 75%–80% of the financial losses due to fraud. As a result, private and public sectors are ramping up their investments in research and development to create increasingly sophisticated systems for detecting fraud. The substantial financial flow172 in E-commerce attracts fraudulent activities, posing a risk of significant financial losses. Juniper Research reported an increase in fraud from $ 17.5 billion in 2020 to $ 20 billion in 2021. These figures underscore the necessity for E-commerce and financial entities to develop fraud detection and prevention mechanisms [10]. Fraud constitutes an illegitimate act characterized by deception. Credit card fraud (CCF) entails unlawfully acquiring a cardholder’s information via telephone communication, text messaging, or cyber hacking to facilitate unauthorized financial transactions. Such fraud- ulent acts are often conducted using software under the perpetrator’s control. The procedure to identify CCF commences when a consumer executes a transaction using their credentials. This transaction must be validated to confirm its legitimacy [10–12]. Efforts in research are geared toward developing detection systems that leverage methodologies like Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learn- ing (DL), and Data Mining (DM). These systems scrutinize transactional data to differentiate between authentic and fraudulent activities. The complexity of detecting CCF is increasing as the characteristics of fraud- ulent transactions become more akin to legitimate ones. Consequently, credit card companies are compelled to implement more advanced fraud detection technologies. An efficient fraud detection system is essential for accurately identifying and detecting fraudulent activities in real-time transactions, broadly categorized into anomaly detection and misuse detection systems [11]. Financial institutions that issue credit cards or manage online trans- actions must use automated fraud detection systems. This reduces losses while increasing customer trust. With the rise of big data and artificial intelligence, new possibilities for using advanced ML models to detect fraud have emerged [13]. Today’s fraud detection systems, which rely on advanced DM, ML, and DL methods, are extremely effective. A binary classification model that can distinguish between normal and fraudulent transactions is built using a data set that includes labeled transactions (normal and fraudulent). The developed model determines whether incoming transactions are legitimate or fraudulent. Detecting fraudulent transactions using classification techniques presents many challenges [14,15]. Automated systems for detecting fraud are essential for financial entities involved in issuing credit cards or handling online transactions, as they help minimize losses and bolster customer confidence. The emergence of big data and artificial intelligence has opened up fresh possibilities in employing sophisticated ML models for fraud detection.\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E. Sorour et al. Alexandria Engineering Journal 104 (2024) 171–192 Fig. 2. Fraud detection in E-Commerce transactions.According to Bao et al. (2022) [13], the latest fraud detection systems leveraging advanced DM, ML, and DL techniques have proven highly effective. The current research investigates CCF, a significant subset of bank- ing fraud. Credit cards, a dominant electronic payment method world- wide, have simplified online transactions and increased fraudulent activities by cybercriminals. Unauthorized use of credit card systems or information, often without the owner’s knowledge, is a growing concern, impacting numerous banks and financial entities globally. Detection of CCF involves automated analysis of transactional data stored in service provider databases. Common fraud types include application and transaction fraud, spanning physical and digital realms. Categories of fraud encompass card-not-present situations, counterfeit cards, and identity theft. Fig. 2 delineates the step-by-step progression of online financial transactions within an e-commerce framework. This diagram identifies critical points where fraud prevention and detection mechanisms are integrated into the consumer’s experience. Banks play a pivotal role in scrutinizing transactions for fraud before payment authorization, notably by checking if the involved website is on a block list. Transactions linked to blocked sites are rejected as a fraud prevention measure. After bank approval, the process transitions from fraud prevention to a focus solely on fraud detection. Preventive measures for application fraud include validation of per- sonal details and detection methods like communal and spike detection. Tools like address verification services, card verification value, 3D security, and encryption are used for transaction fraud. The significance of dimensional attributes in datasets is a pressing issue because they173 can obstruct the effectiveness of classification procedures, potentially causing overfitting or ambiguity in algorithms [16]. FS, a vital preprocessing phase, addresses this issue. This stage entails identifying and eliminating extraneous attributes that adversely affect the performance of the ML model. FS aims to reduce the dimen- sionality of feature sets while preserving performance accuracy. Vari- ous methods have been developed for dataset classification, but Meta- Heuristic have garnered significant attention for their effectiveness in addressing a wide range of optimization problems [17]. MHOA are optimization techniques designed to find approximate solutions for various optimization problems. These algorithms are derivative-free, showcasing ease of use, adaptability, and the ability to circumvent local optima. MHOAs operate stochastically, initiating their optimization process with randomly generated solutions, unlike gradi- ent search methods that require the computation of derivatives in the search space. Their simplicity and straightforwardness, stemming from basic concepts and easy implementation, make these algorithms highly flexible and easily modifiable to suit specific problems. A key charac- teristic of MHOAs is their exceptional capacity to prevent premature convergence. Their stochastic nature allows them to function effectively as a ‘black box’, skirting local optima and thoroughly exploring the search space [18–23]. Utilizing MHOAs to handle FS issues can effectively address var- ious challenges in data analysis. FS is crucial for extracting relevant features from unbalanced datasets, particularly before classifying CCF cases in extensive datasets. The primary benefits of FS include sim- plified data interpretation, reduced training duration, and resolving\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E. Sorour et al. Alexandria Engineering Journal 104 (2024) 171–192 1 t b a q X s s s 2 v c i t a a t M r c a t I i a n f issues related to high dimensionality. Bio-inspired algorithms, adept at tackling complex and combinatorial problems, have been applied effec- tively in detecting CCF. Notable among these is the binary brown bear optimization (BBO) algorithm, a renowned bio-inspired optimization method known for its dual capability of local and global search through exploration and exploitation techniques. This paper employs the BBO algorithm due to its comprehensive search characteristics and provides efficient solutions to computational problems. As a result, extensive research has been conducted to detect finan- cial fraud, yielding a plethora of proposed methodologies, as exten- sively cataloged in the literature (e.g., referenced in Table 2). These methods are predominantly ML, DM, and DL techniques. This study aims to scrutinize the limitations inherent in existing class methodolo- gies, focusing on ML techniques. An empirical investigation utilizing the BBO algorithm, integrated with FS, has been carried out to address the classification dilemma. The aim is to unearth and address the pivotal issues required to develop an efficient and accurate solution for the class conundrum. 1.1. Motivations To solve the challenges of FS in supervised learning, researchers propose a binary version of the BBO algorithm, which is a novel meta- heuristic developed by Prakash et al. [18] and is designed to handle continuous optimization problems based on natural inspirations. The BBO algorithm draws inspiration from the natural behaviors of brown bears, particularly their ability to discriminate between the smell of a pedal and to sniff. The proposed methodology addresses FS problems in supervised learning by considering each brown bear’s unique pedal smell differentiation behavior. This behavior’s main fea- tures include distinct walking styles, cautious stepping, and twisting feet on ground depressions. Additionally, brown bears exhibit sniffing pedal differentiation behavior, which can be leveraged for exploration. The BBO algorithm utilizes these behaviors for the exploitation and exploration phases. The proposed algorithm was verified on the Aus- tralian credit dataset, and significant modifications were demonstrated. This study presents a new strategy for optimization that could improve the accuracy and efficiency of supervised learning classification with a minimization of the number of selected features. The BBO algorithm recommended in this study has distinct ad- vantages that differentiate it from other meta-heuristics and validate its implementation. Firstly, the initial configuration of the BBO al- gorithm is unique, requiring only two hyperparameters: population size and stopping criteria. It eliminates the need for extra parameters, making applying to various optimization problems convenient. This is especially significant for meta-heuristic as coefficients can signifi- cantly impact algorithm performance, and adapting them for various applications can be time-consuming. Moreover, the BBO algorithm depends on the existing best solutions of the brown bears’ group and the information generated by other group members during updates. This feature distinguishes it from most other meta-heuristic, which only depend on existing best solutions, enhancing its overall performance. The Australian credit dataset from the UCI-ML repository was used to determine the algorithm’s effectiveness in selecting essential at- tributes. Three standard ML classifiers, SVM, 𝑘-NN, and Xgb-tree, were employed to calculate the average classification accuracy through 30 separate algorithm executions. 1.2. Contributions The proposed approach offers the following significant contribu- tions that highlight its uniqueness:174 1. An effective methodology based on the BBBO algorithm and machine learning techniques, namely SVM, 𝑘-NN, and Xgb-tree, is suggested in this paper for improving the ability to pre- cisely detect financial CCF transactions occurring during card- holder transactions by identifying relevant features from the provided credit dataset. By focusing on the most pertinent in- formation for FD and reducing the dimensionality of the data, this methodology enhances the detection model’s effectiveness.\n\n2. The introduced methodology relies on the BBO algorithm, which\nis a novel meta-heuristic that no author in any literature has applied before to identify CCF transactions. As a result, its capacity to address this problem has not been investigated.\n\n3. For boosting the methodology’s efficiency by generating a new\npopulation that maintains the main structure but has more ap- propriate positions and avoids falling into a local optimum, the BBO is integrated with an efficient technique called adjusting the positions randomly.\n\n4. A comparison study has been conducted between the suggested\nmethodology and other recent methodologies over the Aus- tralian credit dataset using a variety of evaluation metrics, including mean fitness value, classification accuracy, the se- lected number of features, precision, recall, F-score, ROC_AUC, Kappa, specificity, and MCC.\n\n5. The suggested methodology is characterized from other FD\nmethodologies by its reliance on three well-known ML classifiers to accurately classify, namely SVM, 𝑘-NN, and Xgb-tree, which confirm its dominance compared to its counterparts using a Wilcoxon’s non-parametric rank-sum test (5% significance level).\n\n6. The practical experiments prove the excellence of the proposed\nmethodology and its ability to produce fewer attributes chosen while efficiently enhancing the classification accuracy. Addi- tionally, it is employed to decrease misclassified financial CCF transactions and maximize correctly classified CCF transactions. .3. Structure The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents he current studies that handle fraud detection. Section 3 introduces a rief exposition of the original BBO algorithm; Section 3 elaborates and nalyzes the proposed BBBO algorithm to tackle FS tasks, as well as a uick explanation of the two utilized ML classifiers: SVM, 𝑘-NN, and gb-tree; Section 4 shows the empirical results and comparisons with ome recent approaches, and the conclusion as well as issues for future tudy in Section 5. The abbreviations used throughout this paper are ummarized in Table 1. . Related work In recent years, numerous articles have been published, and sur- eys and reviews of existing FD and prevention strategies have been onducted in the literature. This section delineates various scholarly nvestigations focused on FD. Particular attention is accorded to studies hat have explored FD within the context of class challenges. A diverse rray of methodologies is employed in uncovering fraudulent financial ctivities. Key methodologies can be classified into distinct categories to horoughly examine the most pertinent literature in this field, including L, Cross-Channel Fraud (CCF) detection strategies, ensemble, feature anking methods, and user authentication techniques. Zojaji et al. [24] ategorized credit card FD methods into two main types, supervised nd unsupervised, and offered a detailed taxonomy of the various echniques identified in the literature, emphasizing these categories. t additionally examined the datasets used in each approach, though t did not propose any specific methodology. Conversely, Adewumi nd Akinyelu [25] conducted a survey on online credit card FD using ature-inspired and ML techniques. Their survey covered literature rom 1997 to 2016 and did not elaborate on the methodology used\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E. Sorour et al.

Similarly, Chilaka et al. [26] explored credit card FD methods in the electronic finance and banking sector, selecting relevant articles from 2014 to 2019 and outlining the strategies used. Their focus was on solutions prioritizing rapid response and efficiency, but their review was not systematic and lacked a taxonomy. Aziz and Ghous [27] explored various DM techniques tailored for detecting CCF, focusing on multiple ML strategies such as RF, SVM, Hybrid Methods (HM), DT, and DL. These methods were utilized to identify typical consumer behavior patterns based on past activities. Their review of ML techniques highlighted significant inconsistencies among different studies and suggested areas for future research. Singh et al. [7] proposed a CCF detection model that combines two sequential levels of an SVM with an optimization algorithm inspired by the firefly bio-inspired. The subset of features was optimized in the first level using the firefly algorithm and the CfsSubsetEval feature section 175 method, and the training model for detecting CCF cases was constructed in the second level using the SVM classifier. The model successfully classified 591 transactions with an accuracy of 85.65%. Nguyen et al. [49] suggested a DL method based on convolutional neural networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for detecting CCF on European, Small, and Tall cards across three distinct financial datasets. Sampling techniques were used in the study to address the issue of class imbalance, which resulted in a dramatic reduction in performance on newly unseen data but an improvement on existing examples. The suggested approaches can be used to identify CCF in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by experimental results showing that the suggested DL methods perform better at detecting CCF than conventional ML models. With an F1 score of 84.85%, the LSTM with 50 blocks emerged as the best algorithm when all of the algorithms were compared. For employing various FS algorithms to improve accuracy out- comes, Khushaba et al. [50] introduced a Differential Evolution (DE) optimization method for FS. This method’s effectiveness is evaluated against Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Ahmed et al. [51] detailed the application of FS in detecting intrusions within wireless sensor networks, employing PSO and PCA space, and compared its performance with GA. AL et al. [52] designed an approach to efficiently navigate the exploration and exploitation phases in various optimization challenges. [37] elaborated on an en- hanced credit card risk identification method that utilized algorithms, including DF and SVM, for fraud risk detection. Misra et al. [53] and Schlör et al. [54] implemented under-sampling techniques to create balanced datasets for training DL-based detection models. A notable limitation of under-sampling is its tendency to omit useful data instances from the training set, which could adversely affect detection accuracy. On the other hand, isolation methods have been employed to estimate the data distribution and develop a generative model using various mixture components. This approach to outlier detection has been effectively used in fraud detection, as demonstrated by Buschjäger et al. [55]. Nonetheless, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding thoroughly evaluating the latest ML techniques that utilize under-sampling to address class imbalance issues. The potential of hybrid semi-supervised methodologies, which combine supervised learning with unsupervised outlier detection, has not been fully explored. Moreover, the assessment of fraud detection efficiency in mobile payment systems has been limited to standard performance metrics, overlooking the financial impact of such detections. Hajek et al. [56] aimed to develop a fraud detection system based on XGBoost that also considers such systems’ financial impacts. This system was rigorously tested on a dataset exceeding 6 million mo- bile transactions. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, they compared it with existing ML techniques tailored for handling imbalanced data and detecting outliers. The findings indicated that the semi-supervised ensemble model, which integrates various un- supervised outlier detection algorithms with an XGBoost classifier, outperformed others regarding standard classification metrics. More- over, combining random under-sampling with the XGBoost method yielded the most significant cost savings. Krim et al. [57] characterized an auto-encoder as a specific type of neural network capable of similarly encoding and decoding data. This technique involves training autoencoders specifically on non- anomalous data points. The method relies on assessing reconstruction errors to determine anomalies, subsequently categorizing them as either ‘fraud’ or ’no fraud’. This implies that when encountering un- trained scenarios, the system is likely to identify a higher incidence of anomalies [2]. A nominal increase above the upper threshold value is often flagged as anomalous. This approach has also been applied where an auto-encoder-based network is used for anomaly detection. In the context of ML, a generative adversarial network (GAN) involves two neural networks working in tandem to enhance their predictive capa- bilities. GANs, primarily unsupervised, evolve through a cooperative zero-sum game strategy.\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E. Sorour et al.

This approach harnesses diverse algorithms’ unique strengths to ncrease the accuracy and reliability of FD mechanisms. Their extensive xperimental analyses demonstrate the capability of this method to ffectively address the complexities involved in pinpointing fraudulent ransactions in credit card data. In another significant contribution, bdul Salam et al. [58] have designed a Federated Learning (FL) ramework specifically adapted for CCF detection.

Intelligent sampling optimized the selection of raining samples, thus improving the efficiency of the training process. oncurrently, self-supervised learning is utilized to derive insights from nlabeled data, which is vital for detecting fraudulent transactions. heir research and testing validate that the proposed approach not only oosted FD accuracy but also diminished the computational burden nd reduced reliance on labeled data. Rawashdeh et al. [60] have rafted a method for identifying CCF that incorporated evolutionary lgorithms and random weight networks.

Despite the wide range of methodologies pplied across these studies, many of them have successfully identified raud. Prakash et al. [18] introduced a novel optimization algorithm called he Brown-bear Optimization (BBO) algorithm for addressing the Eco- omic Dispatch Problem (EDP). This problem involves determining the ptimal allocation of generation resources in a power system to meet emand while minimizing costs. The BBO algorithm is inspired by the oraging behavior of brown bears and is tailored to solve optimization roblems efficiently. The algorithm is applied to the EDP, aiming to find he optimal settings for generator outputs while considering constraints uch as generator limits, demand requirements, and operating costs. he study likely evaluated the performance of the BBO algorithm in olving the EDP by comparing it with other optimization algorithms ommonly used for this problem. Through simulations or case stud- es, the effectiveness of the BBO algorithm in achieving approximate olutions for the EDP is demonstrated, highlighting its potential as competitive optimization technique in the field of power system peration and planning. Ojha et al. [63] utilizes the BBO algorithm to adjust the pa- ameters of both Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) and cascaded roportional-Integral-Proportional-Derivative- Integral (PI-PDN) con- rollers for Load Frequency Control (LFC) in a two-area power system ntegrated with renewable energy sources (RES). It employs the Integral f Time multiplied by the Absolute Error (ITAE) objective function o determine the optimal gains for the PID controller. The study ompares the LFC performance achieved with the BBO-tuned PID ontroller against other optimization techniques, specifically the Grey olf Optimization Technique (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization PSO), across various scenarios in the RES-integrated two-area power ystem. Additionally, their study examines the effectiveness of the BBO lgorithm by comparing the performance of both PID and cascaded I-PDN controllers. Simulation results indicate that BBO algorithm utperforms GWO and PSO techniques regarding LFC performance.\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E. Sorour et al.

Proposed methodology for FS\nThe suggested methodology’s ability to address the FS strategy depends on several stages, including initialization, updating position using the BBO algorithm, adjusting positions randomly, binarization, and fitness evaluation. These stages are described in the subsections that follow. 3.1. Setting the population’s initial values A random initial population of 𝑁 possible positions is created at this tage. Each position, represented by the 𝐷 dimensional vector equal o the number of features in the primary benchmark, shows a viable olution within its lower and upper bounds limitations. The resulting andom position is constrained to lie between the [−1, 1] range at each osition vector variable. .2. Updating the positions based on the proposed BBO algorithm The BBO algorithm [18] is an efficient meta-heuristic presented in his paper for updating the positions. The pedal scent distinguishing nd sniffing capabilities of brown bears that differentiate them from ther types of bears have been mathematically modeled to create the BO optimization algorithm that emulates the natural brown bears’ ehaviors. The brown bears’ ability to distinguish between different smells and niff is an efficient means of communication between them and demon- trates their intelligence. The pedal differentiation of these brown bears s distributed over their range, with each group exhibiting its own pedal mell differentiation behavior. Unique walking patterns, careful step- ing, and foot twisting on the ground depressions are the fundamental haracteristics that constitute a group’s pedal smell-discriminating be- avior. Further, these brown bears display the behavior known as niffing pedal differentiation, in which members of the groups prefer o sniff. The exploitation and exploration capabilities of the optimization lgorithm dictate its performance. The exploitation phase of the pro- osed BBO algorithm is based on pedal smell differentiation behavior, hereas the sniffing pedal differentiation behavior handles the explo- ation phase. These two behaviors and the associated mathematical ormulas are briefly explained as follows:\n\n1. Pedal smell differentiation behavior (exploitation phase):\nThree main characteristics set it apart: unique walking patterns, careful stepping, and foot twisting on ground depressions. Us- ing these characteristics, mathematical models are proposed to explain the behavior of pedal smell differentiation.\n\n- Unique walking patterns: Male members of each group\nexhibit special pedal smell differentiation behavior due to their unique walking patterns. The pedal smell differenti- ation behavior is projected to stay over the first third of iterations based on the unique characteristics of walking patterns.\n\n- Careful stepping: The primary purpose of this character-\nistic is enhancing brown bears’ capacity to identify proper pedal differentiation. A brown bear would continuously step on the previous pedal differentiation to let other bears in the group notice them. Based on the careful stepping characteristic, the pedal smell differentiation behavior is expected to improve over the first two-thirds of iterations.\n\n- Foot twisting on ground depressions: The male brown\nbear in each group twists its feet on the ground depres- sions made by previous steps. The previous pedal differ- entiations are determined by combining information from the best and worst pedal differentiations among all the178 pedal differentiations; the brown bear will only twist its feet in response to the previous pedal differentiations that are nearest to the best and furthest from the worst. It is indicated that the pedal smell differentiation behavior improves in the latter third of iterations based on the foot twisting characteristic. After providing a brief explanation of the three main charac- teristics related to the pedal smell differentiation behavior, this behavior can be mathematically formulated as follows:\n\n## ⎧𝑋𝑔 𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 − (𝑃 ⋅ 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑤 ⋅𝑋𝑔\n\n### 𝑖 ) , 𝑖𝑓 𝑃 𝑔 > 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃 𝑔 ≤ 1\n\n3 , ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\n\n## 𝑋𝑔+1 𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 +𝑄𝑔 ⋅ (𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 = 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 − 𝑆𝑔 ⋅𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑊 𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡), 𝑖𝑓 𝑃 𝑔 > 1\n\n## 3 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃 𝑔 ≤ 2\n\n3 , ⎨ ⎪\n\n## ⎪𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 + 𝜔𝑔 ⋅ (𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 − |𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 |) − 𝜔𝑔\n\n## ⎪⋅(𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑊 𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 − |𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 |), 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒,\n\n⎩ (1)\n\n## 𝑃 𝑔 𝑔\n\n## = . (2)\n\n## 𝐺𝑚𝑎𝑥\n\n## 𝑄𝑔 = 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑞 ⋅ 𝑃\n\n## 𝑔 , (3)\n\n### 𝑆𝑔 = 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑(1 + 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠). (4)\n\n### 𝜔𝑔 = 2 ⋅ 𝑃 𝑔 ⋅ 𝜋 ⋅ 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑡. (5)\n\nWhere 𝑋𝑔+1 𝑖 stands for the next upgraded pedal differentiation of 𝑖th brown bears’ group at the next (𝑔 + 1)th iteration, 𝑋𝑔 𝑖 is the current pedal differentiation of 𝑖th brown bears’ group at the current 𝑔th iteration. 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑤 is a random number between [0, 1]. 𝑃 𝑔 indicates the factor of occurrence for 𝑔th iteration, which increases linearly with increasing number of iterations and is expressed as the percentage of the present iteration number 𝑔 to the total iterations’ numbers 𝐺𝑚𝑎𝑥. 𝑋𝑔 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 and 𝑋𝑔 𝑊 𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 define the current best and worst pedal differentiations across whole brown bears’ groups at the current 𝑔th iteration, respectively. The step factor for the 𝑔th iteration is represented by 𝑄𝑔 , and its value relies on the 𝑃 𝑔 factor of occurrence. 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑞 and 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠 depict random numbers distributed equally between 0 and 1. At each iteration 𝑔, 𝑆𝑔 indicates the length of the step and can be assigned either 1 or 2 value; it demonstrates how the best and worst pedal differentiations’ information for the entire popula- tion should be employed to adjust the pedal differentiations. A male brown bear in the appropriate group carefully takes each step forward or backward based on the value of 𝑆𝑔 to establish more recent pedal differentiations. 𝜔𝑔 refers to the twist’s 𝑖th angular velocity at the 𝑔th iteration. 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑡 depicts a random number dispersed equally within [0, 1]. It is important to note that the chosen better bears’ group participates in the subsequent step after this one. The BBO algorithm exploits its surroundings’ knowledge to en- hance its position during the first third of iterations, which is determined by the unique walking patterns. When surroundings are exploited, the algorithm updates the positions in the second third of iterations based on the best and worst pedal differ- entiations in the careful stepping characteristic. The algorithm eventually reaches the exploitation phase in the last third of the iterations, where it adjusts the pedal differentiation’s position vector by veering away from the worst and toward the best. This strengthens the algorithm’s ability to search locally and keeps it from reaching a local optimum.\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E. Sorour et al.

Sniffing behavior (exploration phase): Brown bears can co-\nordinate their motion and communicate with one another by smelling the pedal scent differentiations. When brown bears start to move, they smell randomly chosen pedal differenti- ations in the surrounding region. They migrate only toward the pedal differentiations associated with their group. Math- ematically, the bear’s motion is updated using the following mathematical model once two randomly potential solutions have been selected: {\n\n## 𝑔+1 𝑋𝑔 𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑋 𝑖 + 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛 ⋅ (𝑋\n\n𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 − 𝑘 ) , 𝑖𝑓 𝑓 (𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 ) < 𝑓 (𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑔 𝑘 ),\n\n## 𝑖 = (6)\n\n## 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛 ⋅ (𝑋\n\n𝑔\n\n## 𝑘 −𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 ) , 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.\n\nWhere 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛 denotes a random numeral dispersed equally in the [0, 1] range. 𝑋𝑔 𝑘 refers pedal differentiation of the 𝑘th brown bears’ group at the 𝑔th iteration, as 𝑖 ≠ 𝑘. 𝑓 (𝑋𝑔 𝑔 𝑖 ) and 𝑓 (𝑋𝑘 ) are the values of the fitness function for the 𝑖th and 𝑘th brown bears’ groups at the 𝑔th iteration. Every bear group in the population is subject to the phase above. The more attractive bears are retained and moved to the next iteration from the updated and existing populations. The BBO algorithm implements the exploration phase by using sniffing behavior. The algorithm updates the pedal differenti- ations’ position vectors based on two random population vec- tors. Thus, this phase helps maintain the algorithm’s exploratory capability. 3.3. Adjusting the positions randomly This stage is essential for fixing the unfeasible decision variables that breach the search scope and go out of bounds during position updating, as it changes these variables’ values to random values inside the bounds. This technique improves the exploitation process of the BBO algorithm. It is expressed mathematically as follows: { 𝑋 𝑋𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖,𝑑 , if 𝑋𝐿𝐵\n\n## 𝑑 ≤ 𝑋𝑖,𝑑 ≤ 𝑋𝑈𝐵\n\n𝑑\n\n## 𝑖,𝑑 = (7)\n\n## 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(𝑋𝐿𝐵 𝑈𝐵\n\n𝑑 , 𝑋𝑑 ), if 𝑋𝐿𝐵\n\n## 𝑑 > 𝑋 𝑈𝐵\n\n## 𝑖,𝑑 𝑜𝑟 𝑋𝑖,𝑑 > 𝑋𝑑 .\n\nWhere 𝑋𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖,𝑑 is the valid value of the decision variable, 𝑋𝑖,𝑑 is the value that surpasses the bounds of the variable, 𝑋𝐿𝐵 𝑑 and 𝑋𝑈𝐵 𝑑 represent the lower and upper bounds for decision variable 𝑑, respectively, and\n\n## 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(𝑋𝐿𝐵 𝐵\n\n## 𝑑 , 𝑋𝑈\n\n𝑑 ) returns a random value between 𝑋𝐿𝐵 𝑑 and 𝑋𝑈𝐵 𝑑 with uniform distribution. 3.4. Binary converting of the position To optimize classification accuracy, some features must be chosen for the FS issue, while other features that might impair classifier performance must be rejected. Since mitigating the curse of data dimen- sionality is the primary goal of FS, certain features must be selected, and others disregarded. This stage determines how well the final op- timum solution converges and performs. Therefore, the problem of binary solution representation must be considered to define FS as a binary optimization problem, where solutions are bounded to the binary [0, 1] values. The BBO algorithm’s positions are continuous numbers; hence, handling the binary FS technique directly with them is impossible. To comply with the binary character of FS, an intermediate step called binary conversion must be taken, which converts continuous positions’ values into binary values. This work uses a one-dimensional vector to express a solution, where the length of the solution vector is based on the number of features in the original dataset. Ones in the binary vector represent the continuous values of the relevant features, whereas zeros represent the continuous values of the irrelevant fea- tures. The continuous position 𝑋𝑔 𝑖 can be transformed into a binary position (𝑋𝑔 𝑖 )𝑏𝑖𝑛 at each iteration 𝑔 using the following mathematical formula:179 {\n\n## (𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 )\n\n1 if 𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 > 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑\n\n## 𝑏𝑖𝑛 =\n\n## , (8)\n\n0 otherwise. Where (𝑋𝑔 𝑖 )𝑏𝑖𝑛 represents the resulted binary position obtained at 𝑔th iteration, 𝑋𝑔 𝑖 means the continuous position obtained at 𝑔th iteration, and 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 denotes a random threshold value in the bounds [0, 1]. The determination of the smaller and greater bounds for 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 depends on the problem presented, and their value varies according to the problem status, which requires careful consideration of the context where the binary conversion of positions is applied. In this paper, after examining how positions are represented and distributed within the search space, we found that the positions are represented in the form of probabilities and should fall within the range [0, 1]. Hence, we have concluded that the smaller bound of the 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 value should be 0, and its greater bound should be 1. To gain a thorough understanding of the binary conversion pro- cess, let us assume that the solution 𝑋𝑖 has seven variables, 𝑋𝑔\n\n## 𝑖 =\n\n[0.2, 0.65, 0.8, 0.72, 0.41, 0.33, 0.85]. Then, using Eq. (8), the conversion process is executed to create a binary vector, (𝑋𝑔\n\n### 𝑖 )𝑏𝑖𝑛 = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n\nhere 1 denotes that the feature is picked and 0 indicates that it is not, nd assuming that 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 = 0.5. As a result, only the second, third, and inal features from the original dataset should be kept; the remaining eatures should be removed because they are useless. Each value in the osition vectors is transferred to one or zero in terms of binarization, ignifying that the feature is either picked or not. .5. Evaluating fitness function The accuracy and the size of the chosen features are the two primary pposing aspects that need to be considered when estimating the qual- ty of a solution. When classifier accuracy is maximized, the algorithm’s rediction quality and ability improve while the number of selected eatures in each solution decreases. However, if the size of the selected eatures is reduced more than planned, the accuracy could suffer. herefore, there must be a balance between these two key elements. hus, the fitness function for evaluating the BBO population will deal ith finding a balance between the number of the selected features nd the classifiers’ accuracy, which may be expressed mathematically s follows:\n\n## |𝑑∗|\n\n### 𝑖𝑡 = 𝑤1 × (1 − 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦) +𝑤2 × , (9)\n\n## |𝐷|\n\nThe classification error rate from the classifiers is represented by the expression (1 − 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦), where 𝐷 represents the size of features in the original dataset and 𝑑∗ shows the size of the chosen features. While 𝑤1 is an arbitrary value between [0, 1] and 𝑤2 = 1 − 𝑤1, they represent weight parameters that handle the significance of accuracy and the length of the chosen features, respectively. Based on in-depth testing conducted in previous studies [62,64], 𝑤1 = 0.99 and 𝑤2 = 0.01. The goal is to increase accuracy rather than reduce the length of the selected features, thus 𝑤1 > 𝑤2. 3.6. The entire BBBO algorithm Algorithm 1 provides the pseudo-code for the steps of the BBBO algorithm proposed in the preceding subsections to handle the FS strat- egy. In addition, the proposed BBBO algorithm’s flowchart demonstrat- ing the BBBO algorithm’s key steps is illustrated in Fig. 3. These steps include initializing the population and upgrading the position depend- ing on the four BBO tactics mentioned earlier. These are mathemat- ically divided into two phases: exploration and exploitation, random position adjustment, position binarization, fitness function evaluation, and optimization using the LS strategy.\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E.

Experimental results and analysis This section presents the results of the proposed BBBO algorithm and its comparison with other models. The experimental data was collected from the Australian credit dataset available on the UCI-ML Repository.

Among these, six are numerical features, eight are categorical, and one binary class label indicates the credit application outcome (1 for approval and 0 for denial), as shown in Table 3. The dataset exhibits an imbalance in class distribution, with 307 instances of approved applications and 383 instances of denied applications. Fig. 4 shows the data visualization of the dataset used, representing the relationship between the number of credit card applications and application outcome. According to Fig. 4, it is evident that the number of credit card applications was imbalanced between data classes. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data being utilized for learning and 20% for evaluating the proposed system. A 10-fold cross-validation methodology was used to minimize model error for both training and testing.181 4.2. Parameters configuration The recommended BBBO algorithm was evaluated against binary versions of several meta-heuristic, encompassing nine contemporary algorithms (Binary African vultures optimization (BAVO), Binary Salp Swarm Algorithm (BSSA), Binary Atom Search Optimization (BASO), Binary Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (BHGSO), Binary Harris Hawks Optimization (BHHO), Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), Binary Grasshopper Optimiza- tion Algorithm (BGOA), and Binary Sailfish Optimizer (BSFO)).

The number of features in the benchmark used reflects the problem size. The continuous search domain was set to [−1, 1], allowing individuals to explore within a wide but constrained continuous search space. A ten-fold cross-validation method was utilized in the framework to ensure the reliability of the optimality degrees of the outcomes. This method randomly splits each benchmark into two subsets for training and testing, with the former comprising 80% of the data. The ML model was learned via optimization using the training subset, while the test subset was utilized to assess the selected attributes. Each method’s standard configurations and parameter settings were set based on their primary versions and information from their first publications, as shown in Table 4. The computing environment used Python, an Intel processor core i7, 16 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GTX 1050i GPU. Table 5 displays the main parameters of the ML techniques pre- sented in this study. 4.3.

Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test The effectiveness of the proposed BBBO algorithm was compared to its peers using the Wilcoxon test as a pair-wise test to determine if there was a statistically significant deviation between their perfor- mance metrics [71]. The Wilcoxon test is a non-parametric test used in hypothesis testing, where the difference between the results of two methods on the 𝑗th of 𝑁 problems is first calculated and then sorted based on their absolute values. The negative and positive ranks are then summed, and the smallest value is recorded. The null hypothesis is rejected if the recorded value is less than the 5% significance level. The BBBO algorithm demonstrated superior results to SVM, 𝑘-NN, and Xgb-tree in all cases, as shown in Tables 12, 13, and 14. All p-values recorded in the tables were less than 0.05, indicating that the outcomes achieved by the suggested approach were statistically significant and not the result of chance. 185 Table 12 𝑝-values of the Wilcoxon’s test for the average performance metrics of the BBBO algorithm with SVM against other optimizers.

The effect of changing fitness function In the subsection, The fitness function is reevaluated using 𝐹 -Score (𝐹1) and the size of the chosen features to estimate the quality of a solution. When 𝐹 -Score (𝐹1) is maximized, the algorithm’s classification quality and ability improve while the number of selected features in each solution reduces. However, if the size of the selected features is reduced more than planned, the classification quality could suffer. Therefore, there must be a balance between these two key elements. Thus, the fitness function for evaluating the BBO population will deal with finding a balance between the number of the selected features and the classification quality, which may be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n## |𝑑∗|\n\n### 𝐹 𝑖𝑡 = 𝑤1 × (1 − 𝐹 −𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒) +𝑤2 × , (20)\n\n## |𝐷|\n\nThe classification error rate from the classifiers is represented by the expression (1−F−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒), where 𝐷 represents the size of features in the original dataset and 𝑑∗ shows the size of the chosen features. While 𝑤1 is an arbitrary value between [0, 1] and 𝑤2 = 1 − 𝑤1, they rep- resent weight parameters that handle the significance of classification quality and the number of the chosen features, respectively. Table 15 shows a Comparison of the proposed BBBO algorithm with various meta-heuristics using the three proposed classifiers according to the new reevaluated fitness values. According to the results presented in Table 15, the proposed BBBO exceeds other meta-heuristic according to the new revalued fitness values utilizing the three proposed classifiers (KNN, SVM, Xgb-tree). 4.9. Comparison results of the proposed BBBO algorithm with other re- search utilizing the Australian credit dataset In this section, an analytical comparison is conducted between the newly introduced BBBO algorithm and the prevailing FD techniques utilizing the Australian credit dataset, as illustrated in Table 16. No- tably, ML models such as RF, SVM, DT, MLP, and IBN have an average accuracy of 75%. In addition, FFSVM, FRNN, SOM, FRNN, BSMOTE, ROS, ADASYN, 𝑘-NN, ANN XGR, and XGBoost do not integrate the FS mechanism, and the average overall accuracy is about 80%. However, Pertiwi et al. [74] implemented a Genetic Algorithm FS with XGBoost, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.93%. Also, Em- manuel et al. [75] proposed a stacked classifier approach integrated with a filter-based FS technique for effective credit risk prediction using RF, GB, XGB, ANN, 𝑘-NN, and DT, where the RF model reached the highest accuracy at 87.68%. The Stacked model delivered optimal results with an accuracy of 86.23% and an F1-Score of 84.58%. Addi- tionally, Alex et al. [76] employed a genetic algorithm for FS, SMOTE for oversampling, and a deep 1D-convolutional neural network (DCNN) for classification, achieving high accuracy of 88.23% when compared to other meta-heuristic like Differential Evolution (DE), Whale Optimiza- tion Algorithm (WOA), Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). On the other hand, the BBBO algorithm demonstrated a notable enhancement in the FD system’s efficacy. It achieved a high accuracy rate of 91% and F-Measure = 88%, ensuring the detection of all fraud- ulent activities. This enhancement in performance is further evidenced by superior classification accuracy and a higher true positive rate in the BBBO algorithm, signifying its effectiveness in precisely identify- ing fraudulent instances. Consequently, the BBBO algorithm signifi- cantly reduced the rate of errors, decreased the number of incorrectly classified cases, and elevated the accuracy in detecting fraud.\n\n\n\n---\n\nS.E.

Regarding the F- core, the suggested BBBO with 𝑘NN outperformed its competitors in ight out of ten benchmarks and achieved comparable results in two enchmarks, indicating its efficiency in 100% of all benchmarks. .11. Discussion The experiment results indicate that the BBBO algorithm with SVM, -NN, and Xgb-tree classifiers is more reliable in the classification ask for FS than other current methods. The BBBO algorithm with gb-tree significantly impacted the Australian credit dataset regarding verage classification accuracy, number of selected features, fitness alue results, and F-score. The BBBO algorithm with 𝑘-NN and the BBBO algorithm with SVM were closely followed. Also, the BBBO algorithm demonstrated better exploration and exploitation capabilities than its counterparts, which can be attributed to certain factors. The BBO algorithm, originally continuous, was converted to a bi- nary variant to tackle FS in the classification task. The algorithm was enhanced by adjusting the positions randomly to improve exploration and exploitation. The efficacy of the proposed BBBO algorithm in handling FS in supervised classification was demonstrated using SVM, 𝑘-NN, and Xgb-tree classifiers with the Australian credit dataset from the UCI ML repository. Furthermore, the suggested approaches, including the BBBO al- gorithm with SVM, the BBBO algorithm with 𝑘-NN, and the BBBO algorithm with Xgb-tree, emphasize their ability to achieve optimal results on time by striking a balance between exploration and ex- ploitation. It should be noted that the optimization results may not be exactly repeatable, leading to different subsets of features produced by independent runs of the proposed algorithm. This factor can confuse users, and thus, various applications may utilize the BBBO algorithm or other methods to select different subsets of features. In the end, The proposed methodology is validated using ten bench- mark datasets from the UCI repository. It outperformed its competi- tors in most of the utilized datasets regarding different performance measures.\n\n5. Conclusion\nThe study introduced a cutting-edge algorithm for FS strategies, utilizing the BBBO algorithm and randomly adjusting the positions. This approach yielded impressive results, significantly enhancing the algorithm’s performance and capabilities. Three mainstream classifiers, 𝐾-NN, SVM, and Xgb-tree, were employed to assess the classification accuracy of selected feature subsets. The proposed BBBO algorithm was tested against ten binary versions of leading meta-heuristics on various benchmarks with diverse features and instances. The evaluation involved several performance indicators, such as the average fitness rate, accuracy rate, and the average number of features chosen. The experimental data indicated that the BBO-SVM algorithm outperformed others in FS strategies, delivering notably higher mean accuracy across all benchmarks, with BBO-𝐾-NN following closely. The BBBO algorithm exhibited superior exploration and exploitation compared to its coun- terparts. Furthermore, Wilcoxon’s test (with alpha = 0.05) confirmed the dominance of the BBO algorithm combined with 𝐾-NN, SVM, and Xgb-tree classifiers, achieving up to 90% classification accuracy in some benchmarks and reducing feature size by up to 91%. The proposed methodology is validated using ten benchmark datasets from the UCI repository. It outperformed its competitors in most of the utilized datasets regarding different performance measures. Future research may explore the integration of ML with various meta-heuristics and other classification techniques, like deep learning, to further assess the BBO algorithm’s effectiveness in FS for classification tasks. 190 Future research directions might include examining different forms of BBBO algorithms for DL tasks. There is potential in combining the BBBO algorithm with other MHA for further exploration. Utilizing other classification approaches, like neural networks and LR, could provide deeper insights into the BBBO algorithm’s performance in FS for classification tasks. Applying the BBBO algorithm to discrete optimization problems such as task scheduling, the Knapsack Problem, and the traveling salesman problem may offer new sentiment analysis and intrusion detection systems solutions. Further, a sensitivity analysis of the BBBO algorithm’s core parameters and integrating the BBBO algorithm with other optimization strategies are promising areas for future research.

General flowchart of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture: The GAN consists of two main components: a Generator (G) and a Discriminator (D), both implemented as multilayer neural networks. The Generator takes random noise as input and produces synthetic ’fake’ samples. The Discriminator receives both real samples from the training data and fake samples from the Generator, attempting to distinguish between them. The Discriminator’s output is used to compute both the Discriminator loss and the Generator loss. These losses are then used to update the respective networks through backpropagation. This adversarial process continues iteratively, with the Generator improving at creating realistic fake samples and the Discriminator becoming better at distinguishing real from fake, until an equilibrium is reached.

An autoencoder is first pretrained in an unsupervised manner on all the training images. The decoder of the autoencoder is used to initialize the generator G in BAGAN. And its encoder is used to initialize the first layers of the discriminator D. This initialization enables learning a class conditioning in the latent space of G, where each class c is modeled via a multivariate Gaussian distribution Nc = N (μc,Σc) estimated from encoded samples of that class. During adversarial training, G receives as input random latent vectors Zc ∼ N c corresponding to class label c, and tries to generate realistic fake images of that class. While D tries to classify generated and real images as either fake or belonging to one of the classes. Therefore, BAGAN uses the autoencoder to facilitate conditional generation of minority class images in order to oversample those classes and restore the balance of an imbalanced dataset. The key mathematical concepts are: autoencoder training via l2 loss optimization; modeling each class using the multi- variate Gaussian Nc = N (μc,Σc) and adversarial training of G and D via sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The BAGAN training approach is organized in the three steps showed in Fig. 6. 4.7. Medical generative adversarial network (medGAN) Fig. 4. Architecture of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN): The generator Gϕ(z, y) takes random noise z and class label y as inputs to medGAN [22,30,87] is a generative model proposed to generate produce synthetic data. The discriminator D receives both real data x and synthetic electronic health records (EHR). It combines a generative generated data, along with the class label y, and tries to distinguish between adversarial network (GAN) with an autoencoder to handle real and fake samples. Both networks are conditioned on the class label y to enable class-specific generation and discrimination [31]. high-dimensional multi-label discrete variables representing events in EHRs like diagnoses, medications, procedures etc. An autoencoder is first pretrained in a supervised way to learn salient features of the approximate the true posterior pθ(x∣z, y), while the decoder pθ(x∣z,y) discrete variables.

And its encoder initializes the first Observe that z conditioned on x under the qϕ measure is independent layers of the discriminator D. This allows G to generate distributed of y such that qϕ(z∣x, y) = qϕ(z∣x). It also bears mentioning that other representations of patient records, which are then decoded to synthetic versions of the CVAE differ from the one described above, as discussed in patient records by the pretrained decoder Dec.

GANSO has been applied to various ciency. Although the extra conditional input in CVAE partially controls data types, including EEG, fMRI, and ECG signals, and has demonstrated this issue, it is still challenging for large datasets. the ability to improve classifier performance in scenarios with extreme BAGAN utilizes both VAE and GAN components, so it has even higher computational costs compared to independent GAN and VAE. Since it requires separate training of VAE and GAN components, it can lead to a significant drop in efficiency at large data dimensions. ARAE has the advantage that unlike GAN and VAE, it does not require model structure adjustments for different input sizes and uses a standard ar- chitecture for different datasets. But very long sequence inputs still cause scalability issues leading to reduced efficiency. G-GAN is designed specifically for small-sized low-dimensional nu- merical data, so when volumes become very large or input dimensions become too high, it faces serious scalability constraints. MoGAN benefits from convolutional architectures that scale well to large image data. It also uses group normalization that accelerates the training.

Credit card fraud constitutes a serve issue that might result in huge losses for both people and businesses. It causes billions of dollars in damage each year. The increase in online transactions has led to a rise in credit card fraud cases. Thieves can obtain your credit card details and use them for unauthorized purchases or to open new accounts under your name. This issue, known as credit card fraud, can be quite serious. If you suspect any fraudulent activity on your card, you should contact your bank right away. Financial institutions are constantly developing new techniques to identify and prevent credit card fraud. Despite ongoing advancements in fraud detection technology, staying ahead of constantly evolving criminal tactics remains a significant challenge. Because fraud continually evolves, traditional detection methods, like rule-based systems, often prove ineffective. An effective solution is needed to reduce the harm caused by fraudulent transactions at the outset. These can be solved by using machine learning models, such as OLightGBM, to enable more precise and effective fraud detection. The combination of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Bayesian optimization has demonstrated significant potential in detecting credit card fraud. It outperforms other machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision, and F1 score.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe transition to digital payment can have both positive and negative effects on credit card fraud. For digital payment, users have to provide personal Information and card details, making them potential targets for identity theft and the account takeover. Fraudsters may employ various techniques, such as a phishing, hacking, or social engineering, to gain unauthorized access to individuals’ accounts or steal their identities.The different ways criminals commit credit card fraud can be categorized into distinct types. We will take a look at these various categories [1,4].\n\n● Simple theft (offline fraud): The most basic type of credit card fraud involves stealing a physical card (offline fraud). These thefts are often caught quickly. ● Application Fraud: Involves criminals using fake identities to apply for new credit cards. ● Bankruptcy Fraud: Cardholders who know they cannot afford to repay their debts might commit credit card fraud by exceeding their limits or making purchases with no intention to pay. Credit scoring can help mitigate this risk. ● Internal Fraud: happens when employees with access to card information misuse it for unauthorized transactions. ● Cardholder-not-present Fraud/ behavioural Fraud: Online and mobile transactions lack the security of a physical card present. Fraudsters can steal genuine card details through skimming or shoulder surfing. Advanced fraud detection methods are crucial to identify unusual spending patterns in these situations. It is essential for users to stay vigilant to protect from credit card fraud. Using strong passwords, regularly monitoring accounts, and promptly reporting suspicious activity significantly reduces the risk. Fraud detection can pose several barriers when it comes to implementing machine learning techniques [2] because of imbalanced data, lack of labeled data, feature engineering, real time decision making. Detecting credit card fraud with machine learning can involve using both classification and regression methods, which are widely acknowledged as effective methods for fraud detection. Machine learning algorithms used for fraud detection can be broadly categorized into two types: supervised and unsupervised. unsupervised learning algorithm employs peer group analysis and does not require labeled data. Instead focuses on detecting unusual patterns or anomalies in the data. On other International Conference on Cognitive Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ICCCAI - 2024) AIP Conf.

Numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed [3,4] to identify and prevent credit card fraud.These includes Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (Both Linear and non-linear variants), and K Nearest Neighbors. The effectiveness of these algorithms in categorizing transactions as legitimate or\n\n### fraudulent is assessed in this study in table 1.\n\n\n### TABLE 1.Comparison of different algorithms.\n\n\nAlgorithm Strength Limitation DT Offers simplicity in Prone to understanding and overfitting and interpretation, requiring unable to predict minimal data pre- numeric labels. processing, while providing clear insights into relevant features hold greater relevance for the classification model. SVM Shows resistance to Can be noisy features, operates computationally effectively in spaces expensive to train with high-dimensions, and lacks and retains memory Interpretability. efficiency. RF Exhibit high accuracy Sensitive to and robustness in outliers.\n\n### handling large datasets.\n\n\n## LITERATURE SURVEY\n\n\nFor the purpose of identifying and evaluating theaccuracy of fraudulent transactions, the Authoremployed the Random Forest algorithm (RFA)[5].RFA uses decision trees to classify datasets and is asupervised learning technique. The classificationresults are utilized to create a confusion matrix,serving as a means to assess the performance ofRandom Forest Algorithm. After processing dataset,an accuracy rate of around 90% was achieved. Y.Sahin and E. Duman introduced a hybrid model combining Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Logistic Regression (LR) for classification.[6]. By utilizing real- world dataset, a comparison between ANN and LR methods can be conducted. The classifier generates score of each transaction and classifies them as suspicious or genuine. The study aims to advance the development of effective fraud detection methods by evaluating the performance of these models. The authors presented two distinct algorithms for fraud detection: one based on decision trees and another on random forest [7]. In first strategy, a tree is built using user activities, enabling the identification of potential fraud cases. The seco nd strategy is creating a forest based on user behaviors in order to detect suspicious behavior. Through experimentation, the results reveal that these techniques achieve high levels of precision in detecting fraudulent instances in credit card transactions.\n\nY. sahin et al. [8] introduced an innovative method known as the cost-sensitive decision tree utilized in identification of\ncredit card fraud. By choosing the best splitting characteristic for each non-terminal node, this strategy aims to reduce the overall misclassification costs. Using a real-world credit card dataset, the technique To detect fraudulent activities related to credit cards, the author [9] suggests a brand-new method known as the Naive Bayes enhanced k closest neighbor method (NBKNN). The experimental findings show how effective this method is at correctly categorizing transactions as fraudulent or not. Kaur et al. [10] replaces the naive Bayes classification method with SVM and decision trees enhance the accuracy of detecting fraudulent transactions. The Naïve Bayes classification algorithm, a probabilistic model computes the probability of various target classes to predict the likely outcome of test data. In fraud detection, the Naive Bayes classification algorithm achieved significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure compared to a voting-based approach. These metrics increased by 10-15%, indicating a more effective fraud detection model. 020030-2 17 November 2025 10:16:22\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm [11] has shown promise in fraud detection and outlier identification. Studies suggest it can effectively reduce false alarms while maintaining a high fraud detection rate. The authors [12] compare various ML and DL algorithms on a dataset (potentially addressing data imbalance with techniques like undersampling). The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for fraud prediction, evaluated the model's performance using standard\n\n### metrics like accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall.\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) [13] are a powerful machine learning technique well-suited for real-time fraud detection. This supervised approach is utilized to train and evaluate the system, ultimately delivering a robust and efficient solution for detecting fraud. The study concludes by highlighting SVM as the optimal classifier for this purpose, as it demonstrates superior performance in identifying and flagging fraudulent transactions. By analyzing past transaction details and leveraging behavioral patterns, this method can effectively identify and prevent fraudulent activities, helping banks and financial institutions mitigate the risk associated with credit card fraud.\n\nSahin et al’s work [14] focuses on machine learning approaches like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and decision trees offer promising avenues for building robust classification models to combat credit card fraud. The study distinguishes itself as among the initial research endeavours to evaluate the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and decision trees in detecting credit card fraud using real-world transaction data. The results offer valuable insights for selecting appropriate models enhancing the precision and efficiency of the fraud detection system.\n\nAuthor proposes the Intelligent Learning Scheme for Digital Fraud Detection (ILSDFD), a deep learning-based system using autoencoders for feature selection and classification[15]. It claims superior performance compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.\n\nN. S. S. Pranavi et al. [16] proposes a novel approach to enhance fraud detection. It suggests combining Random Forest\nwith SMOTE, an oversampling technique, to achieve the ambitious goal of 100% fraud detection while minimizing false negatives. This method adds to the continuous exploration of ways to proactively identify and prevent fraudulent\n\n### activity[24],[25],[26].\n\n\nVarious ML algorithms such as XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are explored as fundamental tools. Additionally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to augment fraud detection efficiency, leveraging its layers for accurate detection.Empirical analysis involves experimentation with recent CNN models, adjusting parameters such as hidden layer counts and epochs. Performance metrics including F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall, and Area Under Curve (AUC) are utilized, with improvements noted in achieving high AUC values, enhancing detection accuracy. The author[17] offers a comprehensive approach to remotely detecting fraudulent activities related to credit card fraud, Combining deep learning and machine learning techniques offers a powerful approach to fight fraud in online transactions[27],[28],[29]\n\nThe Author’s[18]objective is to compare the efficacy of three prominent ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision tree classifier, and Random Forest in identifying credit card fraud. Additionally, a novel hybrid model that amalgamates elements of these algorithms to enhance fraud detection capabilities. The model represents a departure from previous studies by incorporating a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of multiple algorithms. Through empirical evaluation, which demonstrates that the model surpasses existing methodologies in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions? By leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning and hybrid modelling techniques, the study contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat credit card fraud effectively in the digital era[30].\n\nB. Gedela et al. [19] proposed AdaBoost algorithm demonstrates that AdaBoost achieves superior credit card fraud\ndetection performance compared to traditional machine learning methods like Naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, ANNs, and decision tree classifier. These findings advance the fields of fraud detection and offer valuable insights for financial institutions seeking reliable solutions to mitigate credit card fraud risks. 020030-3 17 November 2025 10:16:22\n\n\n\n---\n\n## THE OLIGHTGBM ALGORITHM\n\n\nEvery year, enormous financial losses are incurreddue to illegal credit card transactions. Fraud canmanifest in various forms and may range in its extent.Therefore, it is essential to confront the challengesrelated to credit card fraud detection. Furthermore, asnew technologies continue to evolve, criminalsconsistently devise innovative methods to perpetratefraud. Thus, it is crucial to stay ahead of theseevolving threats by actively working on improvingfraud detection mechanisms. In addition to being used in detecting credit card fraud, the OLightGBM approach is also compared against alternative machine\n\n### learning techniques.\n\n\nOLightGBM ● To develop a more effective approach thatcan accurately identify fraudulent activities, thereby minimizing thefinancial losses. ● To show that careful parameter tuning andoptimization contribute to the improved accuracy and overall effectiveness of thealgorithm. ● Highlighting the OLightGBM techniques superior performance over various alternative Machine Learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes classifier, Random Forest, decision tree classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (both radial and linear),. ● To ensuring that the experiment faithfully mirrors the algorithm's performance in real-world situations. ● To demonstrate the superiority of the LightGBM algorithm in the areas of Precision, AUC, Accuracy, and F1-Score.\n\nModules FIGURE 1. illustrates the framework of an intelligent approach for detection of credit card fraud. It has following modules: ● Data Set and Data Preprocessing. ● Feature Selection. ● The Optimized Light Gradient Boost ● Classifier. ● Model Evaluation Using Performance Metrics.\n\n### ● Experimental Results.\n\n\nTo efficiently decrease the dimensionality of training data, LightGBM uses the information gain (IG)approach as a feature selection methodology point the most crucial characteristics. The information gain method helps identify the most informative features for distinguishing legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones. It assigns higher weights to features that contribute most to this classification. The OLightGBM algorithm utilizes information gain as a feature selection method because its computationally efficient and performance well, particularly in terms of accuracy and precision. LightGBM algorithm[20]is equipped with various hyperparameters thatgreatly influence its performance. Traditionally,these hyperparameters are manually set and thenfine-tuned through and iterative trial and errorprocess. The algorithm for Bayesian-basedhyperparameter optimization is applied tointelligently adjust the hyperparameters ofLightGBM algorithm. The LightGBM algorithm bundle unique featurestogether. By creating feature bundles, the algorithmenables the feature-scanning algorithm to generatehistograms based on these bundled features [20].The computation complexity is evaluated usingtheoretical time complexity. In first strategy, a tree is built using user activities, enabling the identification of potential fraud cases. The second strategy is creating a forest based on user behaviors in order to detect suspicious behavior. Through experimentation, the results reveal that these techniques achieve high levels of precision in detecting fraudulent instances in credit card transactions. 020030-4 17 November 2025 10:16:22\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1.Framework of OLightGBM Approach\n\n### Data Set and Data Preprocessing\n\n\nThe real world datasets were used to performdifferent experiments. The dataset used is acompilation of European cardholder transactions,encompassing a total of 284,807 transactions duringSeptember 2013. Within this dataset, Within this dataset, 492 transactions were identified as potentially fraudulent, constituting 0.172% of the overall transaction volume [20]. Comprising 31 features, Initial 28 features (V1 to V28) denote principal components derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) procedure. The implementation of PCA aims to ensure privacy of data. It is noteworthy that two features, namely “Time” and “Amount” have not undergone transformation through PCA. Due to the notable difference in the quantity offraudulent and legitimate transactions, the datasetsexhibit an imbalanced data distribution. This imbalance presents a recognized challenge, as theeffectiveness of various machine learning methodstends to diminish when dealing with imbalanceddatasets. To enhance result accuracy, a cross-validation procedure is employed for training andtesting the model on each subset of the datasets. Theaverage of all measures that have been recorded isthen calculated for the full dataset. Furthermore,alternative techniques like resampling have beenproposed to\n\n### address the challenge posed byimbalanced datasets.\n\n\n### Feature Selection\n\n\nTo efficiently decrease the dimensionality of training data, LightGBM uses the information gain (IG)approach as a feature selection methodology point the most crucial characteristics. The information gain method helps identify the most informative features for distinguishing legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones. It assigns higher weights to features that contribute most to this classification. The OLightGBM algorithm utilizes information gain as a feature selection method because its computationally efficient and performance well, particularly in terms of accuracy and precision [20].\n\n### The Optimized Light Gradient Boost Classifier\n\n\nALGORITHM 1. shows the LightGBM algorithm[20]is equipped with various hyperparameters thatgreatly influence its performance. Traditionally,these hyperparameters are manually set and thenfine-tuned through and iterative trial and errorprocess. The algorithm for Bayesian-basedhyperparameter optimization is applied tointelligently adjust the hyperparameters ofLightGBM algorithm. The LightGBM algorithm bundle unique featurestogether. By creating feature bundles, the algorithmenables the feature-scanning algorithm to generatehistograms based on these bundled features [20].The computation complexity is evaluated usingtheoretical time complexity. It may be expressed as: computation complexity = (  * ) where “m” is number of bundles, which is usually smaller than the total number of features, and “n” denotes number of features in dataset. Tomaintain the accuracy of information gainestimation, LightGBM utilizes the Gradient BasedOne Side Sampling (GOSS) technique. GOSSretains examples with substantial gradients (e.g., 020030-5 17 November 2025 10:16:22\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nthose falling inside the top percentiles or reaching apredetermined threshold) while selecting sampling cases with modest\n\n### gradients. [20].\n\n\n### Model Evaluation Using Performance Matrix\n\n\nCross-validation testing is done to assess how well credit card fraud is detected. The k-fold cross validation (CV) approach was employed to assess the OLightGBM algorithm's efficiency. One popular statistical analysis method is K-fold CV. A five-fold cross-validation (CV) approach is used to assess the performance. The given dataset shows class imbalance, with more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones. In order to get more precise estimations, cross-validation is utilizing for training and testing the model on individual subsets of the datasets. [21]. The performance metrics are then computed and averaged over the entire data set to provide an overall assessment of the OLightGBM algorithm. To ensure robust evaluation on imbalanced datasets, a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) technique is used. The data was randomly divided into five equally sized folds. During each CV iteration, one fold served as the validation set, while the remaining four folds were used for training. Five times this process was repeated, checking each fold was used for validation once.\n\nAn overall assessment of the effectiveness of the OLightGBM algorithm is provided by evaluating its performance through averaging the results from five test subsets. AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy (ACC), Confusion Matrix, and other performance indicators are taken into account. The Confusion Matrix (CM) employs four classification performance metrics: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN)[22]. Derived from these matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are defined. Precision and recall are crucial metrics as they indicate the accuracy and relevance of the findings, particularly in context of imbalanced data [20,23]. The F1-Score merges Precision and Recall, offering a well-balanced metric. The Precision-Recall curve offers insights into the classifier accuracy, especially in imbalanced datasets. Additionally, The AUC value, which signifies the area beneath the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, provides a well-rounded assessment of the model's effectiveness in various scenarios.Regardless of cutoff value, a higher AUC score denotes superior overall performance and is therefore useful for evaluating classifiers. Experimental Results Machine Learning Techniques are compared with the OLightGBM algorithm and then the performance is calculated. 4.The AUC is used to measure how well the predictions are ranked. Also measure the accuracy of the detecting fraud. As score of AUC increases then we can observe the better prediction performance. So, the OLightGBM algorithm achieves\n\n### the highest shows in fig2, fig3 and fig4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 2.Accuracy 020030-6 17 November 2025 10:16:22\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### FIGURE 3.Recall\n\n\n\n\n### FIGURE 4.Precision\n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nNow a days,credit card fraud detection is really significant topic because due to increase in e-commerce,and digital payment system many organizations and financial firms facing the losses.Significant and ongoing financial losses.

Machine Learning (ML) models are among the most prominent techni- ques in detecting illicit transactions. In this paper, we apply the Just-Add-Data (JAD), a system that automates the selection of Machine Learning algorithms, the tuning of their hyper- parameter values, and the estimation of performance in detect- ing fraudulent transactions using a highly unbalanced dataset, swiftly providing prediction model for credit card fraud detec- tion. The training of the model does not require the user setting up any of the methods’ (hyper)parameters. In addition, it is trivial to retrain the model with the arrival of new data, to visualize, interpret, and share the results at all management levels within a credit card organization, as well as to apply the model. The model selected by JAD identifies 32 out of a total of 39 fraudulent transactions of the test sample, with all missed fraudulent transactions being small transactions below 50€. The comparison with other methods on the same dataset reveals that all the above come with a high forecasting performance that matches the existing literature. Introduction The creation of international agreements that promote transactions with credit cards such as the Single Euro Payments Area have significantly eased the use of card payments by consumers and businesses. The total value of card transactions using cards issued in the SEPA area amounted to €4.38 trillion in 2016 (ECB, 2018) and is expected to double by 2025. Nevertheless, along with credit card transactions, we have seen a significant rise in credit card fraud. In 2016, credit card fraud in the SEPA area amounted to €1.8 billion (European Central Bank 2018), while the worldwide incidents rose from $7.6 billion in 2010 to $21.81 billion in 2015 and are expected to reach $31.67 billion in 2020 (Robertson 2016). Despite the increasing effort to alleviate such fraudulent CONTACT Vasilios Plakandaras vplakand@econ.duth.gr Department of Economics, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece © 2022 The Author(s).

The detection of a fraudulent transaction is an ambitious task. First, frau- dulent cases are rare (in our dataset only 1 every 5000 records), rendering the outcome distribution severely skewed. The distribution of fraud cases seems to have seasonality effects and structural breaks as the attack strategies evolve over time (Dorronsoro et al. 1997). Another important issue is the accurate definition of the cost function, given that the cost of a false positive differs from the cost of a false negative (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2014). When the system characterizes a genuine transaction as fraudulent and freezes erroneously that transaction (false positive), the financial institution has an administrative cost to pay, as well as a decrease in customer satisfaction. In the case of frequent false-positive alarms, the financial institution faces the risk of losing customers and gathering adverse publicity. Conversely, when the system fails to detect a fraudulent transaction (false negative), the amount of that transaction is a loss for the financial institution or the merchant. Thus, it is very hard to define the asymmetric loss of each occurrence. Another significant difficulty in fraud detection is that electronic defrauders perform mainly legitimate transactions and occasionally fraudulent ones, rendering the profiling of them into universal standard patterns difficult. Each transaction must be examined separately, rendering the reaction overdue, especially on the non-working hours of electronic transactions. For an actual system to be useful, response to a fraudulent transaction should be almost contemporaneous, which is difficult given that most systems end up forward- ing automatic flagged transactions to (human) fraud examiners for manual inspection. Finally, security and privacy laws limit the public availability of data and/or censor the performed analyses, making them difficult to assess. Credit card fraud can be broadly separated into two categories: identity fraud with the physical presence of the card, and electronic fraud without the physical presence of the card. In the first case the fraud demands the acquisi- tion of the credit card and the identity of the actual owner. In order to perform a transaction, the imposter must be physically present. The second category does not require physical presence of the card or its owner/imposter and is targeted to online transactions, where only identity and safety details are required. The latter category accounts for more than 70% of the worldwide credit card fraud (Robertson 2016), given that no face-to-face contact between seller and buyer is required. Despite the use of several technological improve- ments such as the Address Verification System (AVS), Chip and Pin verifica- tion and the Card Verification Code (CVV), new credit card fraud strategies are continuously being developed. This makes the automated timely detection of fraudulent transactions a very significant defense mechanism in combating fraud and reducing the associated losses to financial institutions.\n\n\n\n---\n\ne2086354-1586 V. PLAKANDARAS ET AL. Modern data-driven statistical and machine-learning (ML) methods can provide statistical-like predictive models that output the probability of a transaction to be fraudulent and address the above challenge. Indeed, ML applications have shown to be promising in fraud detection (see Related Work). However, each such application requires coding its own script, experi- mentation with several algorithms, and significant experience with statistical and machine learning methods as some ML algorithms do not converge in big sample data, some return sub-optimal predictive models, some are inappropri- ate for imbalanced outcomes, others require fine-tuning of their hyper- parameter values, others are hard to explain or interpret, or challenging to combine with feature selection (see Related Work Section). Manual scripting is also time-consuming and prone to methodological errors. Thus, the chal- lenges that arise are “can credit card fraud predictive modeling be automated? Do the resulting models compete with the ones developed by human experts? Does automation obfuscate the interpretation of the model, or can it actually also help in obtaining intuition into the data patterns and task?” To respond to such challenges, systems and services that automate a large part of the machine learning pipeline have recently appeared under the name of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) system. Such systems automate the selection of ML algorithms, the tuning of their hyper-parameter values, the estimation of performance, and the visualization and interpretation of results. In this paper, we demonstrate how AutoML tools could potentially increase the productivity of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions without a reduction in the prediction performance compared to a manual analysis. Specifically, we describe and use the Just Add Data Bio1 (hereafter JAD) AutoML tool on the fraud detection problem described above and achieve results on par with state-of-the-art previous analyses that are manually coded. Secondly, in addition to modeling, JAD performs automated feature selection to identify the most significant variables to fraud detection, providing valuable intuition to fraud inspectors. We’d like to note that JAD’s feature selection considers features jointly (multivariate) and not simply one by one. Features that are informative by themselves may become redundant given other fea- tures; similarly, features that are uninformative by themselves may be neces- sary for optimal prediction and become informative given other features. Hence, optimal feature selection is a combinatorial problem that returns the minimal-size feature subset that in combination leads to the optimally pre- dictive model. After examining numerous combinations of algorithms for feature selection and modeling, as well as their tuning hyper-parameter values, JAD selects the best one to create a final model for prediction. It estimates its predictive performance along several common metrics (e.g., AUC, accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score), the confidence intervals of performance, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and the contribution to per- formance for each selected feature.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAPPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE e2086354-1587 Post-analysis, JAD provides an easy way to access the trained model and apply it on new data to get predictions, without the need for computer coding. This means that any employee of a financial institution or a credit card firm can get predictions and try different scenarios of credit card transactions to gauge how predictions change with the feature values. JAD also supports collaborative analyses by sharing projects, data, and analyses results; the later can also be shared with anybody via unique links to the specific results’ page.2 The present work provides evidence that AutoML systems can indeed address to a large extent the challenges for automated credit card fraud detection modeling, at least within the limited scope of the present computational experi- ments performed. JAD does automatically output predictive models that can compete with prior work, selects the important features for prediction removing irrelevant and redundant features, and helps explain and interpret results. Several limitations of course, remain (see Discussion). Nevertheless, Auto ML can open a new path of research and provide supervision tools to the industry that overcome some of the limitations and obstacles of academic research. Based on this work, we argue that AutoML tools and services should be considered when analyzing credit card transaction data and potentially, other similar-type financial data. The simplicity, accuracy and speed of such systems make them an excellent fit in such financial transaction situations. The model can filter and flag a transaction as probably fraudulent in real time out of thousands of other transactions, keeping human intervention to a minimum. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe in more detail the Related Work. In Section 3, we describe the data and the methodology, while the empirical findings are presented in section 4. Section 5 discusses the limitations of the study, and Section 6 concludes the paper. Related Work The obvious financial benefits in detecting fraudulent transactions has sparked a voluminous literature in the field. The first attempts to create automate detection systems that examine an––often—large number of transactions and classify them as fraudulent or legitimate, are expert systems based on a set of classification rules (Hanagandi, Dhar, and Buescher 1996). Nevertheless, given that the distribution of credit card transaction datasets changes due to seasonality patterns, new market trends and the evolvement of new fraud strategies, the applied rules should be constantly updated, making rule-induction systems infeasible and ineffective. Following an econometric approach, Ng and Jordan (2002) compare logistic regression with Naïve Bayes classification models, showing that logistic regression models have a lower asymptotic error than Bayes classifiers, but fail to converge in very large datasets, as the ones used in credit card transaction problems. The Bayes classifier converges quickly,\n\n\n\n---\n\ne2086354-1588 V. PLAKANDARAS ET AL. but its classification accuracy is lower than that of the logistic regression models. On a similar path, Maes et al. (2002) compare Bayesian and neural networks, concluding that the Bayesian network converges faster and exhibits a lower classification error than neural networks. In an extended benchmark simulation, Lessmann et al. (2015) compare 41 methodologies on various evaluation criteria and several credit scoring datasets. It is confirmed that the random forest method, i.e., the rando- mized version of bagged decision trees, outperforms logistic regression and has progressively become one of the standard models in the credit scoring industry (Grennepois, Alvirescu, and Bombail 2018). Over the last decades, the rapid advances in the field of ML, provided additional tools to the satisfaction of fraud investigators. In a thorough survey of the relevant literature Ngai et al. (2011) conclude that the most commonly used ML methods in fraud detection are decision trees, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and genetic algorithms. These techniques can be used alone or in collaboration using ensemble or meta-learning techniques to build classifiers. Most of the applications are based on supervised training algorithms such as ANN (Dorronsoro et al. 1997; Prodromidis, Chan, and Stolfo 2000; Syeda, Zhang, and Pan 2002; Schindeler 2006; Juszczak et al. 2008; Quah and Sriganesh 2008) decision tree techniques like ID3, C4.5 and CART (Chen et al. 2005; Mena 2003; Wheeler and Aitken 2000) and SVM (Bhattacharyya, 2011). A synopsis of the relevant literature suggests that classification performance of ML methodologies is heavily dependent on the dataset under study, with Bayesian networks and logistic regression exhibiting higher classification performance in smaller samples and ANNs and C4.5 decision trees outper- forming all competing methodologies in larger samples. An obvious contrast of the previous works to the current proposed direction, is that a large part of the effort goes to the identification of the best algorithms for the given task and the optimization of the hyper-parameter. Moreover, as the number of the observations increases, the task of selecting the most informative features becomes a computationally impossible task. Thus, many researchers select a number of variables (often arbitrarily), conditioning the performance of their model to subjective feature selection processes. In contrast, the AutoML approach completely automates feature selection and model tuning. Data and Methodology The Data For our analysis we use a large and frequently used in the literature cross-sectional dataset on credit card fraud detection, available in Dal Pozzolo et al. (2014).3 The dataset includes online credit card\n\n\n\n---\n\nAPPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE e2086354-1589 transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. It con- sists of 492 fraudulent out of a total of 284,807 transactions for a two- day period. Thus, the fraud rate is approximately 0.172% of all transac- tions or approximately 1 in every 579 transactions. The data contains 28 anonymized variables, plus two named variables “Time” and “Amount.” The anonymized variables are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation of the original data for confidentiality issues. The time feature contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The “Amount” feature is the transaction amount. Regarding the anonymized nature of the features, as stated in Carneiro, Figueira, and Costa (2017), the variables typically collected by financial institutions regarding credit card transactions are similar, since they are regulated by monetary authorities. Variable “Amount” ranges from €0.1 to €25,691.16, with an average of �x ¼ 88:35 and a standard deviation of s ¼ 250:12. Table 1 provides an overview of the descriptive statistics of this variable. As we observe from Panel A, the data are severely skewed toward the left tail, while this finding is also highlighted in Panel B, since the majority of transactions are under €200. According to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin tests, the variable is stationary. Just-add-Data JAD is a Software-as-a-Service platform that runs on AWS, available at jadbio. com. JAD employs some simple feature transformations and imputation of missing values. For feature selection, it employs the Statistically-Equivalent- Signature (Lagani et al. 2017) algorithm (SES for short). A feature selection algorithm ideally returns a subset of the features that is minimal in size, and optimally predictive in a multivariate fashion, i.e., when all features are considered jointly. The predictors selected by SES are the neighbors of the outcome in any faithful Bayesian Network representing the data distribution, which a subset of the full Markov Blanket. The latter has been shown to be the optimal solution to the feature selection problem under certain broad condi- tions (Tsamardinos and Aliferis 2003). A feature of SES is that it heuristically and efficiently attempts to identify statistically, equivalent solutions, i.e., mini- mal-sized feature subsets with the same optimal predictive performance. Identifying all equivalent solutions is important when feature selection is employed for knowledge discovery and getting insight to the domain under study. Returning an arbitrarily chosen single solution S may mislead the domain expert into thinking that all other variables are either redundant or irrelevant, when they could just be substituting for a selected feature without loss of predictive power.\n\n\n\n---\n\ne2086354-1590 V.

All the algorithms included above require the user to set the values of hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameters determine the behavior of an algorithm, typically regulating how sensitive the algorithm is in detecting patterns. The optimal values of the hyper- parameters must be found by trial-and-error. Results can vary greatly depend- ing on their appropriate tuning. Using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system JAD automatically decides which algorithms to try and which hyper- parameter values, depending on the size of the data, the type of the data, and the user preferences. The AI system is based on a set of rules that guide the fine-tuning process. JAD then generates all combination of choices called configurations. A configuration is a pipeline of algorithms with specific hyper- parameters that take the data and lead to a forecasting model. To determine which configuration leads to the best model, JAD estimates the performance of the average model produced by each configuration using a (stratified) N-repeated, K-fold cross-validation protocol. The (standard) K-fold cross-validation (CV) protocol splits the data into K non-overlapping approximately equal-sized sets (called folds) of samples. The value K to use is determined by the AI system. The procedure progresses by keeping each fold out once, training models using all configurations on the remaining K-1 folds and estimating their performance on the held-out fold. The held-out test sets are used to simulate the application of the models on new, never- seen-before samples and to estimate the predictive performance obtained by training a specific configuration. In the end, the K performance estimates are computed on each fold, as well as the average, for each configuration. The configuration with the best average performance is selected as the winning configuration. For details on the repetition and stratification of CV see Tsamardinos, Greasidou, and Borboudakis (2018). To produce the final model, JAD applies the winning configuration on the full dataset. The reasoning behind this is that we expect that the model learnt on all the data to be best on average. Unfortunately, the cross-validated performance estimate of the winning configuration is optimistically biased and should not be reported as the final estimate. This is because numerous configurations have been tried. This is a statistical phenomenon conceptually equivalent to the adjustment of p-values in multiple hypothesis testing and related to the “winner’s curse” in biostatistics (Zollner and Pritchard 2007). In computer science it is called the Multiple Comparisons in Induction problem (Jensen and Cohen, 2000). JAD estimates the bias of the performance and the confidence intervals using a bootstrap-based method called Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV or BBC-CV and removes it to return the final performance estimate (adjust estimations for multiple tries of algorithms/configurations).The selection of the optimum\n\n\n\n---\n\ne2086354-1592 V. PLAKANDARAS ET AL. forecasting model is performed based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve, that explores the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity of the model and selects the most cost- effective operational point. In addition to performance estimates, JAD provides several plots to help user understand and interpret results. The first is a Supervised 2D PCA plot, i.e., a 2D PCA plot based on the selected features (hence, the characteriza- tion “supervised”). The goal is to visually understand the data and detect anomalies (outliers) in the dataset. The Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots displays how each instance’s prediction changes when a feature changes, in an effort to explain the role of each feature in the prediction output of the model. The Cumulative Variable Importance aims to explain the added value of each feature to the final forecast. Nevertheless, we do not provide extensive analysis on the feature selection abilities of JAD, given that the 28 variables of the credit-card transaction dataset come from a PCA compression of the original financial variables. Moreover, there is no information regarding the order of the variables; we do not possess infor- mation that the first variable is actually the first component of the PCA analysis, the second variable the second component etc. Thus, we do not present other post-analysis information, given that we cannot actually support evidence of the importance of an actual financial variable in forecasting. Empirical Findings In order to assess the ability of the JAD application to train and forecast credit card fraud in unknown data we split our sample into 2 parts using stratified sampling: 90% of the data are used to train the models and 10% is kept aside and it is only used to test the forecasting ability of the trained model to unknown data. Thus, we use 256,552 observations for training of which 446 correspond to credit card fraud and we left 28,255 observations for testing (46 are credit card fraud cases). Fraudulent transactions are labeled Class 1 and the rest are labeled Class 0. Overall, it took 8 hours and 40 minutes for JAD to train 415 models and test alternative configurations on different subsets of the training data. The best overall configuration in terms of maximizing the Area Under the Curve on the training dataset is: a) selecting features using the SES algorithm with hyper- parameters maxK-conditioning-set = 2 and significance level a = 0.1 and b) fit (learn) a ridge logistic regression model with penalty hyper-parameter lambda = 100. In step a) JAD selected 7 out of the total 30 explanatory variables (features) in our sample as the ones required for the optimal credit card fraud detection. The model with the highest predictive performance is:\n\n\n\n---\n\nAPPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE e2086354-1593 � � Pðy ¼ 1jXÞ ln i ¼ 7:89þ 0:66xi;14  0:51xi;4 þ 0:22x 1 i;10 þ 0:22xi;10 Pðyi ¼ 1jXÞ þ 0:22xi;13 þ 0:13xi;9 þ 0:12xi;12 (1) where Pðyi ¼ 1jXÞ is the probability of observation yi of a transaction belong- ing to Class 1 (fraudulent) of seven regressors where xi,j is the ith observation of variable (feature) . The predictive performance is measured using several metrics reported in Table 2. The simplest of these metrics is classification accuracy, which equals the probability of the model making a correct classification on a new transac- tion. As we observe from Table 2, the overall classification performance of the best performing model is 99,9%. Nevertheless, this metric is not suitable to measure predictive performance in heavily unbalanced datasets. One can achieve a 99.93% accuracy by classifying all transactions as Class 0, since Class 1 (fraudulent cases) accounts only for the 0.172% of all observations. Thus, classification accuracy is a metric that is affected by the class dis- tribution. A better metric typically used for binary classification, is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The AUC is a metric that is independent of the class distribution. It is also invariant to a change in the class distribution between the train and test sets, in other words, it will not be affected if the percentage of fraudulent transactions increases in the test data (provided this is the only change in the data distribution). Nonetheless, as we men- tioned above, we used stratified sampling so that our test and training distribution remain consistent. The AUC also has another, statistically intuitive interpretation: it is the probability that the model will correctly assign a higher probability of being fraudulent to a pair of transactions, Table 2.

The model estimates the probability that a new transaction is fraudulent i.e. P(y = 1|x), given the values x of the seven features of the transaction selected in the training step. To classify a new observation, one uses a threshold t, such that, if the probability is higher than t, the transaction is classified as fraudulent. Depending on t one can become more or less conservative in classifying any transaction as fraudulent. Depending on t one can achieve various values of sensitivity (percentage of fraudulent correctly classified), specificity (percentage of non-fraudulent correctly classified), true positive rate (which equals sensitivity), false-positive rate (which equals 1-specificity), precision, and recall. The ROC curve depicts all the potential tradeoffs between true positive rate and false positive rate (false alarms). Typically, to increase the true positive rate we must accept an increase in the false positive (false alarms) rate as well. The rate of this trade-off is described by the slope of the ROC. The ROC created by JAD for this problem is shown in Figure 1. The evaluation of a fraud detection model is more complex than simply identifying the model with the top predictive performance; the model should also aim at the best cost-effective classification, as it is defined a) by the cost of Figure 1. The ROC curve for Class 1 (fraudulent transactions), along with the respective 95% confidence intervals. The thick dashed (blue) line is the estimated ROC from the training data. Different points on the ROC curve provide a different trade-off between False Positive Rate (FPR) and the true positive rate (sensitivity) of the classifier. JAD can output models operating at different FPRs by selecting any of the circles.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAPPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE e2086354-1595 Table 3. The confusion matrix.

JAD can produce models that operate on any thresh- old and achieve several sensitivity-specificity trade-offs. The metrics shown in Table 2 are calculated with a threshold of 0.0481, selected from the ROC curve during the training phase, as the threshold that maximizes true positive rate and minimizes false-positive rate for Class 1. Balanced accuracy refers to the average of the proportion corrects of each class individually to account for the seriously imbalanced nature of the dataset. As we observe from Table 2, in terms of detecting fraudulent transactions (sensitivity of Class 1) our classifier achieves 78% on the training and 85% on the test sample, while the identification of legitimate transactions (specificity) reaches 100% in both cases. For the visualization of our results, in Table 3 we report the confusion matrix of the train and test sample. The best model identified by JAD correctly identified 39 out of the 46 fraudulent transactions (84.78%), missing only 7 transactions (15,22%) and producing 10 false positives. Thus, out of the 49 cases of credit card transactions that would be flagged for manual inspection, only 10 cases would be false alarms. Given that we are provided with the exact amount of each transaction we can study the behavior of the model on each of the observed instance of Table 3. The descriptive statistics are reported in Table 4. The economic valuation of the credit card fraud detection by JAD is very interesting. The ridge regression model correctly identified 39 frau- dulent transactions saving 7,535.24€ to the financial institution, while it has missed 7 transactions with a total cost of 477.64€. Most of the missed instances are small transactions below 50€ (39.90€, 11.39€, 3.39€ and the rest are below 1€), while only two transactions (311,91€ and 108,51€) exceed the amount of 100€. The false alarm transactions are all transac- tions below 1€ except one transaction of 89.90€. Thus, JAD exhibited the ability to efficiently detect all financially significant fraud transactions (above 500€) and to minimize the financial fraud cost and the adminis- trative cost of manual inspection.\n\n\n\n---\n\ne2086354-1596 V.

More specifi- cally, Dal Pozzolo et al. (2015) is the first use of the dataset in our study. The authors train Logit Boost, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers in forecasting credit card fraud based on an under- sampling scheme. Awoyemi et al. (2017) train a Logistic Regression, a Naïve Bayes and a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in forecasting credit card fraud using the same dataset, but without feature selection. Fiore et al. (2019) use the same dataset to produce artificial fraudulent transactions using a Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network (DLANN), in order to balance the dataset. Then, the artificial data are merged with the original dataset and a new DLANN is trained on the balanced dataset, keeping the last 30% observations for model evaluation (out-of-sample forecasting). Their application requires tuning 2 DLANN models that is a computationally intense and time- consuming procedure, while it requires expert knowledge and is prone to handling errors. The comparative results pertaining to fraudulent transactions (Class 1) in out-of-sample forecasting are reported in Table 5. Table 5. Comparison to earlier studies. Plakandaras et al.

Limitations In terms of limitations, the current version of JAD does not automatically detect data distribution drift, perform automated data cleaning, raise alarms when the model seems to be invalidated in new samples, and in general, lacks functionalities for automatic model maintenance. In addi- tion, it requires formatting the data as a 2-dimensional matrix. In practice however, credit card data are originally stored in relational databases and require extensive data engineering for feature extraction and construction, a step that is not automated. A limitation of the specific study stems from the fact that the features have been linearly transformed using PCA on the original measured quantities. This precludes the economic and financial interpretation of the selected features. Further experimentation with more financial datasets is necessary to generalize further the conclusions of the study. Conclusion In this paper we use an AutoML SaaS platform, namely JAD, to credit cards fraud detection on a dataset of 284,807 online transactions. JAD automatically performs imputation, feature selection, modeling, fine tun- ing of the hyper-parameters of a significantly large number of models and estimates predictive performance and confidence intervals. The automatic nature of the application provides model training and model selection in a manner that shields against methodological errors and is accessible to all users, expert and non-experts alike. Moreover, the user- friendly interface makes the retraining of the model effortless and the model update straightforward. The gains in generality and applicability do not come at the expense of forecasting performance, given that our approach has matched or superseded existing applications on the same dataset.

ABSTRACT People can use credit cards for online transactions as it provides an efficient and easy-to-use facility.With the increase in usage of credit cards, the capacity of credit cardmisuse has also enhanced. Credit card frauds cause significant financial losses for both credit card holders and financial companies. In this research study, the main aim is to detect such frauds, including the accessibility of public data, high-class imbalance data, the changes in fraud nature, and high rates of false alarm. The relevant literature presents many machines learning based approaches for credit card detection, such as Extreme Learning Method, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and XG Boost. However, due to low accuracy, there is still a need to apply state of the art deep learning algorithms to reduce fraud losses. The main focus has been to apply the recent development of deep learning algorithms for this purpose. Comparative analysis of both machine learning and deep learning algorithms was performed to find efficient outcomes. The detailed empirical analysis is carried out using the European card benchmark dataset for fraud detection. Amachine learning algorithmwas first applied to the dataset, which improved the accuracy of detection of the frauds to some extent. Later, three architectures based on a convolutional neural network are applied to improve fraud detection performance. Further addition of layers further increased the accuracy of detection. A comprehensive empirical analysis has been carried out by applying variations in the number of hidden layers, epochs and applying the latest models. The evaluation of research work shows the improved results achieved, such as accuracy, f1-score, precision and AUC Curves having optimized values of 99.9%,85.71%,93%, and 98%, respectively. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms for credit card detection problems. In addition, we have performed experiments by balancing the data and applying deep learning algorithms to minimize the false negative rate. The proposed approaches can be implemented effectively for the real-world detection of credit card fraud.

Thus, the CNN is widely used of normal distribution. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is in image processing.

The LSTM network is compatible For image processing, the purpose of using a CNN is to with categorising, processing and building predictions based minimise processing without losing key features by reducing on time sequence data.

In a real-world transaction, fraudulent and non- fraudulent classes are not balanced due to the nature of the problem. For instance, if one million transactions are per- formed in a day, only a few can be fraudulent. The convo- lutional neural network model with 14 layers architecture is applied to the balanced dataset to validate the proposed model. The model is trained over 100 epochs. The CNN 14 layers architecture obtained 94.60 and 95.80 % training and validation accuracy respectively as shown in Table 7. Figure 15 depicts the accuracy and loss of CNN model using FIGURE 14.

This is because DL algo- rithms require a large quantity of data to fully learn features. ML algorithms are less accurate than deep learning algo- FIGURE 17.

The rise in both virtual and physical payment platforms has contributed to a surge in fraud cases, causing substantial financial losses to individuals and organizations. In 2022, for instance, individuals in the United States reported losing over $8.8 billion to fraud—an increase of 30% from the previous year, as reported by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) (Innan et al., 2023). As a result, financial institutions and businesses are under increasing pressure to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems in order to mitigate losses and protect consumers (Chy, 2024; Chen et  al., 2025; Chen et al., 2020). Machine learning (ML) has become a critical tool for analyzing large volumes of financial transaction data to detect patterns of fraudulent behavior (Ismail and Khorsheed, 2023; Ali et al., Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence 01 frontiersin.org\n\n\n\n---\n\nAlbalawi and Dardouri 10.3389/frai.2025.1643292 2022; Jha et al., 2012). Unlike traditional statistical methods, ML real-time fraud detection systems using ML algorithms in combination algorithms can uncover complex, nonlinear relationships and adapt to with resampling and feature selection. Meanwhile, recent studies have evolving fraud tactics over time (Shah and Sharma, 2023; Manorom shown how data augmentation (Khalid et  al., 2024), federated et al., 2024). Classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision learning, and hybrid ML-DL approaches (Btoush et  al., 2025; Trees, and Random Forests have shown promise in identifying hidden Bhattacharyya et  al., 2011) can further improve accuracy and patterns and anomalies within financial data (Hashemi et al., 2023; generalizability across diverse datasets. Kumar et al., 2020; Hernandez Aros et al., 2024). These models have Other works, such as Manorom et al. (2024) and Kumar et al. become increasingly effective in real-time and large-scale fraud (2020), explored comparative analyses of various algorithms, showing detection scenarios (Borketey, 2024; Salunke et al., 2025). the utility of random forest and support vector machines in high- A key challenge in fraud detection, however, is the severe class dimensional transaction data.

This techniques and anomaly detection strategies tailored for overlapping imbalance often results in biased models that fail to detect minority- and minority classes in credit card datasets. class instances effectively. To address this, the Synthetic Minority In this study, we  extend prior research by incorporating the Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) has been widely used to generate Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the synthetic examples from the fraud class, thereby balancing the dataset significant class imbalance typically observed in credit card fraud and improving model learning (Btoush et  al., 2025; Baisholan datasets. We perform a systematic evaluation of Logistic Regression, et al., 2025). Decision Tree, and Random Forest models on a real-world transaction In this study, SMOTE is employed to enhance the performance of dataset, focusing on improving predictive accuracy and model three classification models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and robustness. To further enhance detection performance, we develop a Random Forest—on a real-world credit card fraud dataset. A deep deep learning model that integrates focal loss, enabling the model to learning model using focal loss is also implemented to prioritize hard- focus on harder-to-classify fraudulent cases.

An ensemble of algorithms was utilized, including Logistic Regression (LR), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GB), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), each chosen to address the distinct challenges posed by the dataset's skew. Preprocessing techniques, such as Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling methods, were implemented to correct class imbalances, followed by feature selection through Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to enhance model training efficacy. The experimental results showcased that the ensemble methods, particularly RF, outperform, offering high accuracy and specificity, evidenced by an accuracy rate of 0.9995 using ADASYN in an 80:20 training-test split. These methods effectively handled the imbalanced nature of the dataset while maintaining high levels of predictive reliability. This study demonstrates the efficacy of ensemble machine learning approaches in detecting fraud in datasets characterized by class imbalance. The strategic application of oversampling techniques, coupled with ensemble models, provides a robust framework for identifying fraudulent activities, thereby significantly reducing the risk associated with such transactions.

INTRODUCTION\n\nCredit card fraud has become a significant concern in today's digital era, with the rapid growth of online and offline transactions. The increasing volume of card-based payments, coupled with advancements in e-commerce and digital payment platforms, has led to a surge in fraudulent activities. Fraudsters continuously adapt and employ new techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in the system, making it challenging for traditional detection methods to keep pace. As a result, credit card fraud detection systems need to evolve to effectively identify and mitigate fraudulent transactions in real-time, minimizing financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions. The traditional methods of fraud detection, such as rule-based systems and manual checks, have proven to be inadequate in handling the large volumes of data generated by modern payment systems. These methods often suffer from high false-positive rates, inefficient processing times, and difficulty in detecting novel fraud techniques. Consequently, there has been a shift towards leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms to automate and improve the fraud detection process. ML algorithms are capable of learning from historical data, identifying complex patterns, and adapting to new fraud techniques, offering a more scalable and accurate solution. Machine learning techniques, particularly supervised learning models, have shown great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of credit card fraud detection. Algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression have been extensively used for classifying transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. However, despite the success of these models, they face limitations in dealing with imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are much fewer than legitimate ones. This imbalance often leads to biased models that are less sensitive to detecting fraudulent activities. To address these challenges, researchers have begun exploring more advanced ML approaches, such as ensemble learning, deep learning, and hybrid models. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve performance, while deep learning techniques like Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown superior ability to capture intricate patterns in transaction data. Additionally, techniques such as anomaly detection and Copyright to IJARSCT DOI: 10.48175/568   1 www.ijarsct.co.in\n\n\n\n---\n\n### IJARSCT  ISSN (Online) 2581-9429\n\n\n\nInternational Journal of Advanced Research in Science, Communication and Technology (IJARSCT) International Open-Access, Double-Blind, Peer-Reviewed, Refereed, Multidisciplinary Online Journal Impact Factor: 7.53 Volume 4, Issue 4, November 2024 unsupervised learning are being applied to detect previously unseen fraud patterns.

EXISTING SYSTEM\n\n\nFig.1 System Architecture The existing systems for credit card fraud detection generally focus on monitoring real-time transactions using a combination of rule-based systems, statistical methods, and machine learning algorithms. In earlier systems, fraud detection primarily relied on manually defined rules that were created based on patterns of fraudulent activity identified by experts. These rule-based systems were effective in some scenarios but had significant limitations. They struggled to adapt to evolving fraud techniques and couldn't handle complex transaction patterns. Furthermore, these systems often resulted in high false positive rates, leading to legitimate transactions being flagged as fraudulent, which caused inconvenience to cardholders and financial institutions. Over time, machine learning techniques were introduced to overcome the limitations of rule-based systems. Early machine learning models, such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM), were implemented to detect fraud. These models learned from historical transaction data, where features like transaction amount, time, merchant type, location, and frequency of transactions were used as inputs to identify potentially fraudulent activity. However, these early models still faced challenges with data imbalance, where fraudulent transactions were much fewer than legitimate transactions, leading to poor model performance and low detection accuracy for rare fraud cases. The models also required constant retraining and fine-tuning to adapt to new fraudulent techniques, which added complexity to their use.

These techniques combined the outputs of multiple weak classifiers to form a stronger model, improving the detection rate of fraudulent transactions. However, despite these improvements, ensemble methods were still limited by the inability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and the inherent difficulty in detecting subtle fraud patterns. In some cases, model explainability was another issue, as these methods were often treated as black-box models, making it difficult to interpret the decision-making process and understand why certain transactions were flagged as fraudulent. The emergence of deep learning algorithms has revolutionized fraud detection systems. Unlike traditional machine learning models, deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), are capable of automatically extracting features from raw data, removing the need for extensive manual feature engineering. These models are designed to recognize complex patterns and have shown remarkable performance in detecting fraud in credit card transactions, particularly in high-dimensional data scenarios. Deep learning approaches not only improve the detection rate but also reduce false positives by identifying subtle patterns in data that traditional methods might miss. Additionally, deep learning models can be trained on larger datasets, which is critical in an era where fraud detection must handle millions of transactions daily. Despite the advancements, the existing systems still face challenges, particularly in terms of data imbalance, model interpretability, and adaptability to new fraud trends. Current systems also require robust computational power and extensive training datasets to achieve high accuracy. Additionally, the deployment of deep learning models for fraud detection often involves significant infrastructural investments, making them less accessible for smaller financial institutions. Therefore, while significant progress has been made, the need for more efficient, scalable, and interpretable fraud detection models remains. Future systems will need to address these challenges to stay ahead of evolving\n\n### fraudulent activities.\n\n\n## IV. FUTURE SCOPE\n\nThe future scope of credit card fraud detection lies in further enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of detection systems by integrating advanced deep learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and hybrid models that combine multiple algorithms. Additionally, the use of real-time data streams, along with the incorporation of anomaly detection and unsupervised learning, can enable systems to detect new and unknown fraud patterns more effectively. With the continued development of explainable AI (XAI), future systems will offer greater transparency, allowing financial institutions to understand and trust the model's decisions. Moreover, advancements in edge computing and blockchain technology may contribute to faster, more secure fraud detection while ensuring privacy and data integrity\n\n### in transaction processing.\n\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, credit card fraud detection has made significant strides with the integration of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, offering enhanced accuracy and reduced false positives. While traditional rule-based systems and early machine learning methods were foundational, they were limited in handling complex, evolving fraud patterns. The introduction of advanced models, such as ensemble learning and deep neural networks, has improved detection rates and adaptability to new fraud techniques. However, challenges like data imbalance, model interpretability, and computational costs still persist. The future of fraud detection systems lies in the continuous refinement of these technologies, with a focus on real-time, scalable solutions that can quickly adapt to emerging fraud trends while\n\n### ensuring data privacy and system transparency.\n\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1].

This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based credit is available at the end of the card fraud detection engine using the genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection. article After the optimized features are chosen, the proposed detection engine uses the fol- lowing ML classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayes (NB). To validate the performance, the proposed credit card fraud detection engine is evaluated using a dataset generated from European cardholders. The result demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms existing systems. Keywords: Machine learning, Genetic algorithm, Fraud detection, Cybersecurity Introduction In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth of the Internet. This has sparked the proliferation and increase in the use of services such as e-commerce, tap and pay systems, online bills payment systems etc. As a consequence, fraudsters have also increased activities to attack transactions that are made using credit cards. There exists a number of mechanisms used to protect credit cards transactions including credit card data encryption and tokenization [1]. Although such methods are effective in most of the cases, they do not fully protect credit card transactions against fraud. Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows com- puters to learn from previous experience (data) and to improve on their predictive abilities without explicitly being programmed to do so [2]. In this work we implement Machine Learning (ML) methods for credit card fraud detection. Credit card fraud is defined as a fraudulent transaction (payment) that is made using a credit or debit card by an unauthorised user [3]. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), there were about 1579 data breaches amounting to 179 million data points whereby credit © The Author(s) 2022.

Journal of Big Data            (2022) 9:24 Page 2 of 17 card fraud activities were the most prevalent [4]. Therefore, it is crucial to implement an effective credit card fraud detection method that is able to protect users from financial loss. One of the key issues with applying ML approaches to the credit card fraud detection problem is that most of the published work are impossible to repro- duce. This is because credit card transactions are highly confidential. Therefore, the datasets that are used to develop ML models for credit card fraud detection contain anonymized attributes. Furthermore, credit card fraud detection is a challenging task because of the constantly changing nature and patterns of the fraudulent transactions [5]. Additionally, existing ML models for credit card fraud detection suffer from a low detection accuracy and are not able to solve the highly skewed nature of credit card fraud datasets. Therefore, it is essential to develop ML models that can perform opti- mally and that can detect credit card fraud with a high accuracy score. This research focuses on the application of the following supervised ML algorithms for credit card fraud detection: Decision Tree (DT) [7], Random Forest (RF) [8], Arti- ficial Neural Network (ANN) [12], Naive Bayes (NB) [11] and Logistic Regression (LR) [6]. ML systems are trained and tested using large datasets. In this work, a credit card fraud dataset generated from European credit cardholders is utilized. Often- times, these datasets may have many attributes that could have a negative impact on the performance of the classifiers during the training process. To solve the issue of a high feature dimension space, we implement a feature selection algorithm that is based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) [25] using the RF method in its fitness func- tion. The RF method is used in the GA fitness function because it can handle a large number of input variables, it can automatically handle missing values, and because it is not affected by noisy data [9]. The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. The second section provides an overview of the classifiers that are used in this research. Section III provides a litera- ture review of similar work. Section IV provides the details of the dataset used in this research. Section V outlines the GA algorithm. Section VI. explains the architecture of the proposed system. We conduct the experiments in Section VII. The conclusion is presented in Section VIII. Classifiers Logistic regression The Logistic Regression (LR) classifier, sometimes referred to as the Logit classifier, is a supervised ML method that is generally used for binary classification tasks [6]. LR is a special type of linear regression whereby a linear function is fed to the logit function. y = α0 + α1X1 + α2X2 + · · · + αnXn (1) 1 q = −y (2) 1+ e where the value of q will be between 0 and 1. q is the probability that determines the pre- diction of a given class. The closer q is to 1, the more accurately it predicts a particular class.\n\n\n\n---\n\nI leberi et al. Journal of Big Data            (2022) 9:24 Page 3 of 17 Decision trees and random forest Decision Tree (DT) is a supervised ML based approach that is utilized to solve regres- sion and classification tasks. A DT contains the following types of nodes: root node, decision node and leaf node. The root node is the starting point of the algorithm. The decision node is a point whereby a choice is made in order to split the tree. A leaf node represents a final decision [7]. The RF method conducts its predictions by using an ensemble of DTs [8]. In the RF, a decision is reached by majority vote. The follow- ing is a mathematical definition of the RF [10]: Given a number of trees k, a RF is defined as, RF = {g(X , θk)} , where {θk} represents independent identically distributed trees that cast a vote on input vector X. The label with the most votes is the prediction. Naive Bayes The Naive Bayes (NB) is a supervised ML technique that is based on Bayes’ theorem. The NB method assumes the independence of each pair of attributes when provided with the dependant variable (the class). In this research, the Gaussian NB (GNB) clas- sifier was used. With the GNB, we assume that the probability of the attributes is Gaussian as explained in Equation (3). ( ) 1 (x 2 n − βy) P(xn|y) = √ exp −\n\n## 2 2 (3)\n\n2 2 α παy y where βy and αy are computed using the maximum probability. Artificial Neural Network Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a supervised ML method that is inspired from the inner workings of the human brain. The simplest ANN have the following basic structure: an input layer, one hidden layer and an output layer. The input layer size is based on the number of features in a given dataset. The hidden layer size can be var- ied based on the complexity of a task and the output layer size depends on the type of problems to be solved. The most basic component of an ANN is a node or neuron. In this research, we consider feed forward ANNs. Therefore, the information flows in one direction (from its input to its output) through a neuron [12]. Figure 1 depicts a graphical representation of a simple ANN with 3 nodes in the input layer, a hidden layer with 4 nodes and an output layer with 1 node. Related work In ref. [13], the authors implemented a credit card fraud detection system using sev- eral ML algorithms including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). These classifiers were evaluated using a credit card fraud detection dataset generated from European cardholders in 2013. In this dataset, the ratio between non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions is highly skewed; therefore, this is a highly imbalanced dataset. The researcher used the clas- sification accuracy to assess the performance of each ML approach. The experimental\n\n\n\n---\n\nIleberi et al. Journal of Big Data            (2022) 9:24 Page 4 of 17 Fig. 1 ANN outcomes showed that the LR, DT, SVM and RF obtained the following accuracy scores: 97.70%, 95.50%, 97.50% and 98.60%, respectively. Although these outcomes are good, the authors suggested that the implementation of advanced pre-processing techniques could have a positive impact on the performance of the classifiers. Varmedja et  al. [14] proposed a credit card fraud detection method using ML The authors used a credit card fraud dataset sourced from Kaggle [19]. This dataset contains transactions made within 2 days by European credit card holders. To deal with the class imbalance problem present in the dataset, the researcher implemented the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) oversampling technique. The following ML methods were implemented to assess the efficacy of the proposed method: RF, NB, and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The experimental results demonstrated that the RF algorithm performed optimally with a fraud detection accuracy of 99.96%. The NB and the MLP methods obtained accuracy scores of 99.23% and 99.93%, respectively. The authors concede that more research should be conducted to implement a feature selec- tion method that could improve on the accuracy of other ML methods. Khatri et al. [15] conducted a performance analysis of ML techniques for credit card fraud detection. In this research, the authors considered the following ML approaches: DT, k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), LR, RF and NB. To assess the performance of each ML method, the authors used a highly imbalanced dataset that was generated from Euro- pean cardholders. One of the main performance metric that was used in the experi- ments is the precision which was obtained by each classifier. The experimental outcomes showed that the DT, KNN, LR, and RF obtained precisions of 85.11%, 91.11%, 87.5%, 89.77%, 6.52%, respectively. Awoyemi et al. [16] presented a comparison analysis of different ML methods on the European cardholders credit card fraud dataset. In this research, the authors used an hybrid sampling technique to deal with the imbalanced nature of the dataset. The fol- lowing ML were considered: NB, KNN, and LR. The experiments were carried out using a Python based ML framework. The accuracy was the main performance metric that was utilized to assess the effectiveness of each ML approach. The experimental results demonstrated that the NB, LR,and KNN achieved the following accuracies, respectively: 97.92%, 54.86%, and 97.69%. Although the NB and KNN performed relatively well, the authors did not explore the possibility to implement a feature selection method.\n\n\n\n---\n\nI leberi et al. Journal of Big Data            (2022) 9:24 Page 5 of 17 In ref. [4] the authors utilized several ML learning based methods to solve the issue of credit card fraud. In this work, the researchers used the European credit cardholder fraud dataset. To deal with the highly imbalanced nature of this dataset, the authors employed the SMOTE sampling technique. The following ML methods were considered: DT, LR, and Isolation Forest (IF). The accuracy was one of the main performance met- rics that was considered. The results showed that the DT, LR, and IF obtained the accu- racy scores of 97.08%, 97.18%, and 58.83%, respectively. Manjeevan et  al. [17] implemented an intelligent payment card fraud detection sys- tem using the GA for feature selection and aggregation. The authors implemented sev- eral machine learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of their proposed method. The results demonstrated that the GA-RF obtained an accuracy of 77.95%, the GA-ANN achieved an accuracy of 81.82%, and the GA-DT attained an accuracy of 81.97%. Research methodology Dataset In this research, we use a dataset that includes credit card transactions that were made by European cardholders for 2 days in September 2013. This dataset contains 284807 transactions in total in which 0.172% of the transactions are fraudulent. The dataset has the following 30 features (V1,.., V28), Time and Amount. All the attributes within the dataset are numerical. The last column represents the class (type of transaction) whereby the value of 1 denotes a fraudulent transaction and the value of 0 otherwise. The features V1 to V28 are not named for data security and integrity reasons [19]. This dataset has been used in ref. [4, 13, 14, 16] and one of the key issues that we discovered is the low detection accuracy score that was obtained by those models because of the highly imbal- anced nature of the dataset. In order to solve the issue of class imbalance, we applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) method in the Data-Preprocess- ing phase of the proposed framework in Fig. 5 [18]. The SMOTE method works by pick- ing samples that are close to each other within the feature space, drawing a line between the data points in the feature space and creating a new instance of the minority class at a point along the line. Feature selection Feature selection (FS) is a crucial step when implementing machine learning meth- ods. This is partly because the dataset used during the training and testing processes may have a large feature space that may negatively impact the overall performance of the models. The choice of which FS method to use depends on the kind of problem a researcher is trying to solve. The following paragraph provides an overview of instances where using a FS method improved on the performance of ML models. Kasongo [20] implemented a GA-based FS in order to increase the performance of ML based models applied to the domain of intrusion detection systems. The results demonstrated that the application of GA improved the performance of the RF clas- sifier with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98. Mienye [21] et al. implemented a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to increase the performance of stacked sparse autoencoder network (SSAE) coupled with the softmax unit for heart disease prediction. The PSO technique was used to improve the feature learning capability\n\n\n\n---\n\nIleberi et al. Journal of Big Data            (2022) 9:24 Page 6 of 17 of SSAE by optimally tuning its parameters. The results demonstrated that the PSO- SSAE achieved an accuracy of 97.3% on the Framingham heart disease dataset. Hema- vathi et  al. [22] implemented an effective FS method in an integrated environment using enhanced principal component analysis (EPCA). The results demonstrated that using the EPCA yields optimal results in supervised and unsupervised environments. Pouramirarsalani et  al. [23] implemented a FS method using hybrid FS and GA for fraud detection in an e-banking environment. The experimental results demonstrated that using a FS method on a financial fraud datasets has a positive impact on the over- all performance of the models that were used. In ref. [24], the authors implemented the GA-based FS method in conjunction with NB, SVM and RF algorithms for credit card fraud detection. The experimental output demonstrated that the RF yielded a better performance in comparison to the NB and SVM. Genetic algorithm feature selection The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a type of Evolutionary inspired Algorithm (EA) that is often used to solve a number of optimization tasks with a reduced computational overhead. EAs generally possess the following attributes [25, 26]:\n\n- Population EAs approaches maintain a sample of possible solutions called popu-\nlation.\n\n- Fitness A solution within the population is called an individual. Each individual is\ncharacterized by a gene representation and a fitness measure.\n\n- Variation The individual evolves through mutations that are inspired from the\nbiological gene evolution. In this study, the RF approach is used as the fitness method inside the GA. Further, the RF method is employed because it resolves the problem of over-fitting that is gen- erally encountered when using regular Decision Trees (DTs). Moreover, RF performs well with both continuous and categorical attributes and RF are known to perform optimally on datasets that have a class imbalance problem. Additionally, the RF is a rule-based approach; therefore, the normalising of data is not required [27]. The alter- native to the RF include tree-based ML algorithms such as Extra-Trees and Extreme Gradient Boosting [28, 29]. The fitness method is defined a function that receives a candidate solution (a feature vector) and determines whether it is fit or not. The measure of fitness is determined by the accuracy that is yielded by a particular attrib- ute vector in the testing process of the RF method within the GA. Algorithm 1 pro- vides more details about the implementation of RF in the GA. Algorithm 1 denotes the pseudo code implementation of the fitness function that was used in the GA. This algorithm consists of 6 main steps. In step 1, the data (20% of the full Credit Card Fraud dataset) is divided into a training ( Ftrain and ytrain ) and testing ( Ftest and ytest ) subsets. In Step 2, an instance of the RF classifier is instanti- ated. In Step 3, the RF instance is trained using the training set. In Step 4, the result- ing model is then evaluated using the testing data ytest . In Step 5, the predictions are stored in ypred . In the last step, the evaluation process is conducted using ypred .\n\n\n\n---\n\nI leberi et al. Journal of Big Data            (2022) 9:24 Page 7 of 17 During the evaluation procedure, the accuracy is used as the main performance met- ric. The most optimal model is one that yields the highest accuracy score. Algorithm 2 is a pseudo code that represents the computation process of a candi- date feature vector. In the initialization phase, the clean Credit Card Fraud dataset is loaded. In the second phase, we define all the variables that will be used in the com- putation procedure of a candidate feature vector. This includes the following: a list, A, that will store the names of all the features that are present in the Credit Card Fraud dataset; y represents the target variable; B denotes an empty array that will store the most optimal feature names. k represents the total number of iterations required to compute a candidate feature vector. Once the definition phase is completed; in Step 1, we generate the initial population (feature names) and store them in A. In Step 2 and Step 3, Algorithm 2 is computed. The fitness value, q is generated in Step 4. q deter- mines whether a candidate feature vector is optimal or not. If a candidate feature vec- tor is not optimal; we compute the crossover (k-point crossover, where k = 1 ), the mutation, the fitness (from Step 6 to Step 10). This process is conducted iteratively till the algorithm converges. The convergence point is decided once the maximum accu- racy has been reached over k iterations. The main steps of the GA that was adapted to our case study are depicted in Fig. 2. This flowchart represents the compact version of the implementation of the pseudo code in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 [30].\n\n\n\n---\n\nIleberi et al.

These vectors contain the feature names that represents the most optimal attrib- utes that will be used to assess the effectiveness of our proposed method. Fraud detection framework The architecture of the proposed methodology is depicted in Fig. 3. The initial step is computed in the Normalize Inputs block whereby the training dataset is normalized using the min-max scaling method in Equation (4) [31]. The scaling process is done to ensure that all the input values are within a predefined range. The GA algorithm is implemented in the GA Feature Selection block using the normalized data from the Normalize Inputs block. At each iteration of the GA Feature Selection block, the GA generates a candidate attribute vector vn that is used to train the models in the Train- ing block represented by the Training data and Train the models blocks.

Performance metrics The research presented in this paper is modeled as a ML binary classification task. Therefore, we use the accuracy (AC) that was obtained on the test data as the main performance metric. Additionally, for each model, we compute the recall (RC), the precision (PR) and the F1-Score (F-Measure) [32]. To assess the classification quality of each model, we further plot the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The AUC is a metric that reveals how effective a classifier is for a given classification task. The value of the AUC varies between 0 and 1 whereby an efficient classifier would have an AUC value close to 1 [33].\n\n- True positive (TP): attacks/intrusions that are accurately flagged as attacks.\n- True Negative (TN): normal traffic patterns/traces that are successfully catego-\nrized as normal.\n\n- False positive (FP): legitimate network traces that are incorrectly labeled as intru-\nsive.\n\n- False Negative (FN): attacks/intrusions that are incorrectly classified as non-intru-\nsive.\n\n\n\n---\n\nIleberi et al.

The compute speci- fications are as follows: Intel(R) Xeon(R), 2.30GHz, 2 Cores. The ML framework used in this research is the Scikit-Learn [35]. Results and discussions The experiments were carried out in two folds. In the first step, a classification process was conducted using F = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} . For each feature vector in F, the following methods were trained and tested: RF, DT, ANN, NB and LR. The results are depicted in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. As shown in Table 2, both the ANN and the RF algorithms obtained the highest test accuracy (TAC) of 99.94% using v1 . However, the RF method obtained the best results in terms of precision. In Table 3, the results that were obtained using v2 demonstrate that the best model is the RF approach with an accuracy of 99.93%. In Table 4, the RF method also obtained the best fraud detection accuracy of 99.94% using\n\n\n\n---\n\nI leberi et al.

Table  5 presents the results that were achieved by v4 whereby the DT obtained an accuracy of 99.1% and a precision of 81.17%. Table  6 depicts the outcomes that were obtained when using v5 .

Furthermore, we computed the AUC of each vector in F. These results are depicted in Figs.  4, 5, 6, 7, 8. In Fig. 4 ( v1 ), the best performing models in terms of the quality of classification are the RF, NB, and LR with the AUCs of 0.96, 0.97, and 0.97, respec- tively. In the instance of v5 (Fig 8), the RF and NB obtained the highest AUCs of 0.95 and 0.96. Moreover, a comparison analysis is presented in Table 7. This comparison reveals that the GA feature selection approach presented in this paper as well as most of the proposed ML methods that were implemented outperformed the existing techniques that are proposed in [4, 13, 14, 16].For instance, the GA-RF proposed in this research obtained an accuracy that is 2.28% higher than the LR in [13]. The GA-DT proposed in this work yielded a fraud detection accuracy that is 4.42% higher than the DT model presented in [14]. The GA-LR obtained an accuracy that is 2.41% higher than the SVM model presented in [13]. The GA-NB proposed in this research achieved an accuracy that is 1.75% higher than the KNN model proposed in [16]. Additionally, the GA-DT presented in this research achieved an accuracy that is 17.23% greater than the accuracy obtained in [17]. In terms of classification accuracy, the most optimal classifier is the RF (implemented with v5 ). This model achieved a noteworthy credit card fraud detection accuracy of 99.98%. Experiments on synthetic dataset To validate the efficiency of our proposed method, we conducted more experiments using a publicly available synthetic dataset that contains the following features: V = { User, Card, Year, Month, Day, Time, Amount, Use Chip, Merchant Name, Merchant City, Merchant State, Zip, MCC, Errors, Is Fraud} , where Is Fraud denotes the target variable. This dataset contained 24357143 legitimate credit card transactions and 29757 fraudulent ones [36]. In the experiments, we considered the following methods: RF, DT, ANN, NB, and LR. We first processed the dataset through the framework in Fig. 5. The GA module selected the features represented by v0 in Table 8. These were the features that were used during the training and testing processes of the ML models. Table 9 pro- vides the details of the results that were obtained after the experiments converged. The GA-ANN and the GA-DT achieved accuracies of 100%. These results are backed by AUCs of 0.94 and 1, respectively. The other models that performed remarkably well are the GA-RF and the GA-LR with accuracies of 99.95% and 99.96%. However, the GA-LR yielded a low AUC of 0.63 (Table 10).\n\n\n\n---\n\nI leberi et al.

The GA was implemented with the RF in its fit- ness function. The GA was further applied to the European cardholders credit card transactions dataset and 5 optimal feature vectors were generated. The experimen- tal results that were achieved using the GA selected attributes demonstrated that the GA-RF (using v5 ) achieved an overall optimal accuracy of 99.98%. Furthermore, other classifiers such as the GA-DT achieved a remarkable accuracy of 99.92% using v1 . The results obtained in this research were superior to those achieved by existing meth- ods. Moreover, we implemented our proposed framework on a synthetic credit card fraud dataset to validate the results that were obtained on the European credit card fraud dataset. The experimental outcomes showed that the GA-DT obtained an AUC of 1 and an accuracy of 100%. Seconded by the GA-ANN with an AUC of 0.94 and an accuracy of 100%. In future works, we intend to use more datasets to validate our framework.

Usage of credit cards has resulted in the growth of online business advancement and ease of the e-payment system. The use of machine learning (methods) are adapted on a larger scale to detect and prevent fraud. ML algorithms play an essential role in analysing customer data. In this research article, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the literature review considering the ML techniques for credit card fraud detec- tion (CCFD) and data confidentiality. In the end, we have proposed a hybrid solution, using the neural network (ANN) in a federated learning framework. It has been observed as an effective solution for achieving higher accuracy in CCFD while ensuring privacy.

Advanced technologies such as machine learning have been widely employed to enhance the early detection and prevention of losses arising from potentially fraudulent activities. However, a prevalent approach in existing literature involves the use of extensive data sampling and feature selection algorithms as a precursor to subsequent investigations. While sampling techniques can significantly reduce computational time, the resulting dataset relies on generated data and the accuracy of the pre-processing machine learning models employed. Such datasets often lack true representativeness of real- world data, potentially introducing secondary issues that affect the precision of the results. For instance, under- sampling may result in the loss of critical information, while over-sampling can lead to overfitting machine learning models. In this paper, we proposed a classification study of credit card fraud using fundamental machine learning models without the application of any sampling techniques on all the features present in the original dataset. The results indicate that Support Vector Machine (SVM) consistently achieves classification performance exceeding 90% across various evaluation metrics. This discovery serves as a valuable reference for future research, encouraging comparative studies on original dataset without the reliance on sampling techniques. Furthermore, we explore hybrid machine learning techniques, such as ensemble learning constructed based on SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and decision tree, highlighting their potential advancements in the field. The study demonstrates that the proposed machine learning models yield promising results, suggesting that pre-processing the dataset with sampling algorithm or additional machine learning technique may not always be necessary. This research contributes to the field of credit card fraud detection by emphasizing the potential of employing machine learning models directly on original datasets, thereby simplifying the workflow and potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nMachine learning; credit card fraud; ensemble learning; non-sampled dataset; hybrid AI models; European credit card holder This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\n\n\n---\n\n34 JCS, 2023, vol.5 1 Introduction As technology evolves, traditional cash payments are gradually yielding to cashless transactions. This shift provides consumers with a more convenient approach for conducting transactions from the comfort of their homes, leveraging internet technology. Consequently, there has been a surge in the utilization of e-commerce services, online billing payment, and near field communication (NFC) or contactless payment [1]. Credit card, as a digital payment tool, empowers consumers to make advance payments within a predetermined credit limit. Consequently, many online retailers and physical stores now offer credit card payment services, which have gained global prevalence [2]. Unfortunately, this prevalence has also attracted the attention of fraudsters who seek to exploit credit card transactions. According to reports from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), more than 1,579 data breaches have occurred, with credit card frauds accounting for the highest number of cases among various form of digital frauds. As a result, it has become imperative to identify potentially fraudulent transactions to safeguard user accounts and mitigate financial loss. The sheer volume of data, compounded by the categorization of records, has made it increasingly challenging to process and analyse fraudulent transactions using conventional statistical methods [3]. Moreover, many datasets are unbalanced, with normal transactions significantly outnumbering fraudulent ones, possibly leading to misrepresentation of attributes and the inadvertent neglect of crucial information. In response to these challenges, robust and intelligent classification techniques such as machine learning models, have been proposed. Various supervised machine learning models, including decision trees, logistic regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), can be trained and employed for fraud detection. However, most machine learning studies in credit card classification have been conducted using oversampled or under- sampled datasets [4]. It is important to note that such sampling techniques do not uncover the genuine patterns of fraudulent transactions but are primarily aimed at conserving computational time when dealing with extensive datasets. Over-sampling involves duplicating minority class datasets, potentially leading to overfitting or the classification of similar data points. Conversely, under-sampling reduces majority class datasets, risking the loss of critical information and underfitting. In essence, the sampled datasets are artificially generated and may not faithfully represent the actual patterns of fraudulent transactions. Machine learning models trained on such sampled data lack reliability, resulting in inconsistent detection accuracy and the potential approval of fraudulent transactions, ultimately leading to client losses. Therefore, it is essential to formulate accurate models based on the original dataset to identify the behaviour of hijacked accounts. In this study, we aim to assess the performance of several machine learning models in classifying credit card fraudulent transactions using the original European card holders’ dataset [5], without employing sampling techniques. We also explore various combinations of machine learning models, including ensembled stacking, to enhance research comprehensiveness. We believe this investigation will provide valuable insights for future research, particularly by facilitating performance comparisons of machine learning models when applied to original datasets. Replicating identical sampled datasets used in previous studies is virtually impossible, making our research results a valuable addition to this limited knowledge space. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related works. Section 3 elaborates on the machine learning models and associated techniques employed in the study. Section 4 discusses the results and evaluates the performance of these machine learning models. Finally, Section 5 presents conclusions, discusses limitations, and outlines future improvements.\n\n\n\n---\n\nJCS, 2023, vol.5 35 2 Related Works This section provides an overview of recent studies in credit card fraud detection employing machine learning techniques. Dornadula et al. [2] applied various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and SVM, to classify fraudulent transaction. Due to dataset imbalance, they proposed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address this issue. Results showed that random forests achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy, precision, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 99.94%, 93.10% and 82.68%, respectively. Notably, common over-sampling methods introduce unwanted data or overfitting, potentially affecting result reliability. Itoo et al. [6] introduced random under-sampling (RUS) to resample original datasets at different fraud-to-non-fraud ratios (25:75, 50:50, and 75:25). They compared the performance of logistic regres- sion, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) on the resampled dataset, with logistic regression consistently outperforming other models, achieving a maximum accuracy of 95.9%. However, the authors noted potential information loss and suggested improved sampling methods as future work. In 2022, Ileberi et al. [4] applied SMOTE to resample the original dataset and employed genetic algorithms combined with random forests to achieve the highest accuracy of approximately 99.98%, while genetic algorithms paired with decision trees or artificial neural networks achieved 100% accuracy on specific datasets. The authors acknowledged the need for further research given the limited dataset and training vectors used. In the same year, Alfaiz et al. [1] conducted machine learning training directly on the original dataset, arguing that the recorded transactions in the original dataset represent the real-world without missing information. After preprocessing the dataset with principal component analysis for customer information anonymization, they found that Category Boosting (CatBoost) produced the highest accuracy of 99.96% following a resampling technique with AllKNN technique. Recently, Afriyie et al. [3] compared the performance of logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests in credit card fraud detection using the dataset from the Western United States. They applied an under-sampling technique to balance the data distribution, resulting in a 50:50 ratio between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The study concluded that random forests achieved the best performance, with an accuracy rate of approximately 96%. These studies, conducted over the past three years, predominantly employed datasets from European cardholders [5]. It is evident that most of these studies rely on resampling of the original datasets, potentially leading to information loss and overfitting. In alignment with the arguments put forth by Alfaiz and Fati, it is suggested that all the processed vectors are equally important, and further processing may not be necessary. Consequently, our study aims to conduct a similar machine learning investigation on the European dataset without sampling or feature reduction methods. This holistic approach allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the selected machine learning algorithms performances concerning the roles of all the existing feature vectors. Our study also includes a comparative analysis of the selected machine learning models and explores the potential advantages of hybrid or stacking approaches.\n\n\n\n---\n\n36 JCS, 2023, vol.5 3 Machine Learning Models and Methodology 3.1 Machine Learning Models 3.1.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM) The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm renowned for its efficiency in both regression and classification tasks. It operates by identifying an optimal hyperplane within a high-dimensional space to segregate distinct classes. In the context of credit card fraud detection, SVM excels due to its ability to manage high-dimensional data and capture intricate nonlinear relationships among features. To tackle high-dimensional datasets, SVM employs a kernel function that transforms data points into a higher-dimensional space, where it can delineate data using an appropriate hyperplane. SVM, as noted by Zareapoor et al. [7], is particularly apt for binary classification tasks such as credit card fraud detection. It seeks to establish a separator or hyperplane that distinguishes the dataset into positive and negative classes. Two critical factors contributing to SVM’s precision in classifying data with multiple features are kernel representation and margin optimization. Through data transformation from 2-D to 3-D, the hyperplane achieves enhanced classification accuracy. Moreover, in higher-dimensional spaces, the model considers a multitude of feature dimen- sions, reducing the likelihood of misclassifications. In such cases, the one-dimensional separation vector in 2-D becomes a two-dimensional separation plane in 3-D space. Chen et al. [8] conducted comparative study between SVM and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for credit card fraud detection. While ANN yielded slightly more accurate results than SVM, it often suffered from overfitting issues, a drawback not observed in SVM. Consequently, we propose employing SVM over ANN in our subsequent study of credit card fraud classification. 3.1.2 K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm classifies data points based on a specified distance metric, calculating distances to query data points [9]. One commonly used distance metric in KNN is the Euclidean formula, determining the nearest neighbors. The ‘K’ value in KNN represents the number of nearest neighbors considered for predictions. Typically, ‘K’ is set as an odd number to serve as a tiebreaker in determining classification outcomes. In this study, we set ‘K’ to approximately 115 for better coverage of neighbouring data points in classification. During classification, the model identifies the nearest neighbors within the training dataset and assigns labels based on the majority class’s closest distance to the subject data point [10]. As suggested by Maneesha [10], KNN excels in solving classification related problems. 3.1.3 Decision Tree (DT) The Decision Tree (DT) machine learning model is another powerful method with significant applications in credit card fraud detection [11]. It is frequently employed for both classification and regression tasks within supervised learning algorithms [12]. The primary objective of a decision tree is to efficiently create tree-like structure that divides data points into different groups by determining the most informative features at each split. Decision trees excel in managing complex and high-dimensional datasets, especially in the context of credit card fraud detection [13]. They can effectively discern patterns and correlations among various transactional attributes, facilitating the differentiation between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.\n\n\n\n---\n\nJCS, 2023, vol.5 37 One key advantage of decision trees is their ability to handle both numerical and categorical data without necessitating extensive data preprocessing. This makes them particularly suitable for credit card transaction data, which often comprises diverse attributes. The decision tree algorithm operates by recursively dividing the data into subsets based on feature values. At each node, it selects the most informative feature to split the data into classes. This process continues until leaf nodes, representing final classification choices such as ‘fraudulent’ or ‘non-fraudulent,’ are generated. These nodes enable the model to predict new and unforeseen fraudulent credit card transactions. To enhance the robustness and generalization of the decision tree model, hyperparameter adjust- ments are crucial [14]. Thoughtful parameter selection, including the maximum tree depth, minimum samples required internal node splitting, and minimum samples needed at leaf node, mitigates overfitting and ensures reliable performance with new data. The interpretability of decision trees is a critical aspect in credit card fraud identification. Due to their tree-like structure, analysts and investigators can easily follow the decision-making process, simplifying the understanding of why a particular transaction was labeled as fraudulent or not. This transparency bolsters the model’s predictability. However, decision trees may challenges when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets, a common occurrence in credit card fraud detection scenarios where fraudulent transactions are relatively infrequent compared to legitimate ones. In such cases, ensemble techniques like random forests or gradient boosting may be more suitable, as they can enhance model performance by amalgamating different decision trees. 3.1.4 Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) Adaptive boosting, commonly referred to as AdaBoost, is an ensemble learning technique that leverages boosting to construct a robust model through a series of weak learners [15–17]. The term ‘Adaptive’ in AdaBoost signifies its ability to adjust the weights of misclassified samples by the current weak learner, gradually building a strong leaner. A visual representation of AdaBoost is depicted in Fig. 1, where weak learner 3 learns from weak learner 2, which in turn learns from the errors made by weak learner 1. Eventually, the classification boundaries learned by these three weak learners are combined to create a strong learner. The AdaBoost algorithm places significant emphasis on sample weights, highlighting the impor- tance of misclassified samples training. This is achieved by assigning higher weights to misclassified samples or data points after each iteration, enabling the model to focus more on these challenging samples in subsequent iterations. In a study conducted by Chowdary et al. [18], AdaBoost exhibited the highest accuracy, reaching 94.389%, when compared to other boosting techniques. In this work, we will explore a fundamental AdaBoost model implemented with 100 decision stumps serving as weak learners to construct a final robust classifier model. A decision stump consists of only one level or a single split, connecting the root directly to its leaves. In simpler terms, a decision stump makes predictions based on a single input feature. The weights of the stump models are updated during each training iteration based on the performance of each decision stump in classifying the samples until the optimal performance is achieved.\n\n\n\n---\n\n38 JCS, 2023, vol.5 Figure 1: General conceptual process for AdaBoost technique to adaptively improve mistakes made by each weak learner to form a strong learner 3.1.5 Blending Blending is one of the stacking methods that involves partitioning the data into training and hold-out validation sets to enhance model performance [19]. The validation set serves as a hold- out set for the target output, utilized in the weak learner to make relevant predictions in line with our training dataset. Multiple heterogenous weak learners are individually trained to produce base predictions. These predictions from the weak learners serve as input features for our meta-learner. The meta-learner is trained to effectively combine the predicted output from the validation set to achieve superior predictions. Once the meta-learner is trained, the entire training set is utilized to predict the test data, resulting in optimized predictions. The blending architecture, comprising two model levels, is illustrated in Fig. 2, with the weak learner as the zero-level model and our meta leaner as the first- level model. The validation set, composed of the predicted output from the weak learner, is situated between these levels and is fed into the meta learner. Blending follows a similar procedure to the bagging technique, where weak learners are ensembled in parallel to generate their individual prediction. However, in bagging, each weak learner contributes equally to the meta-learner, regardless of the model’s performance. Blending adopts a weighted average ensemble approach, where the contribution of the meta-learner’s result is weighed based on the trust in the predicted output for generating the best prediction. A generalization of this approach involves employing Linear Regression or Logistic Regression for regression or classification problems, as the meta-learner assigns weightage to the model features contributed by the meta learner. According to Soleymanzadeh et al. [20], the ensemble blending technique achieved the highest accuracy at 93.46% compared to other stacking methods. However, the general stacking technique had a longer training time of 21.71 s due to division of the training dataset into multiple equalized folds during cross-validation. In contrast, blending required approximately 8.42 s for training. Therefore, they concluded that blending is the preferred choice for credit card fraud detection with a simplified\n\n\n\n---\n\nJCS, 2023, vol.5 39 dataset. The quicker training time facilitates faster production of final predictions by the ensemble model. Figure 2: The general conceptual representation of blending architecture For this study, the blending model is implemented by integrating SVM, KNN, and decision tree. 3.2 Evaluation Metrics Upon training the model with a vast dataset of credit card transactions, it becomes imperative to assess its performance and results. In the field of machine learning, a plethora of evaluation metrics is available, including Recall (RC), F1-score, Precision, Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Area Under the Curve (AUC), Log Loss, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and more. Nevertheless, within the context of credit card fraud detection, specific metrics are commonly preferred due to the inherent imbalance characteristics in the datasets. The following paragraphs elucidate the frequently employed metrics for the classification of fraudulent credit card transactions, which will be applied in this study [1,4,21]. Accuracy (AC) quantifies the frequency with which a model makes correct predictions on a scale ranging from 0 to 1, often represented as a percentage. An AC value approaching 1 signifies highly accurate results, while a value nearing 0 indicates low accuracy. The formula for AC is as follows: Number of correct predictions\n\n## AC =\n\nTotal number of predictions = True positive + True negative 1) True positive + ( False postive + True negative + False negative While AC measures overall accuracy, recall (RC) is utilized to gauge how effectively the model correctly identifies positive cases from all actual positive instances within the dataset. Analogously, an\n\n\n\n---\n\n40 JCS, 2023, vol.5 RC value approaching 1 indicates high sensitivity, while a value approaching 0 suggests low sensitivity. The equation for RC is as follows: RC = Number of correct positive predictions Total number of actual positive instances = True positive True positive + (2) False negative F1-score is an evaluation metric that combines precision and RC scores to assess the model’s class- wise performance rather than overall performance like AC. A model that produces no false positive predictions will have a precision close to 1. A higher F1-score value indicates that the model maintains a good balance between precision and RC value. The formula for the F1-score is as follows: Precision = Number of correct positive predictions Total number of instances the model predicted as positive = True positive (3) True positive + False positive F1 − score = 2 × Precision × RC ( Precision + 4) RC On the other hand, some researchers employ Area Under Curve (AUC) to evaluate the perfor- mance of binary classification models. Nevertheless, AUC can yield misleading scores as it is highly influenced by the number of correct or incorrect predictions. AUC considers the true positive rate and false positive rate of the model across various cut-off thresholds [22,23]. It is also referred to as the ‘Area Under the Curve’ because it represents the area under the “Receiver Operating Characteristics” (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is plotted with the true positive rate against the false positive rate, making it a popular metric for assessing the model’s ability to distinguish between classes. AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate good model performance, while low values close to 0 indicate poor model performance. 3.3 Experimental Procedure The experiment was conducted utilizing the original European credit card dataset on a branded laptop equipped with AMD Ryzen 7 4800 H processor and NVIDIA GTX 1650 graphic card. Approximately 80% of the data was employed as the training set, while the remaining 20% was reserved to assess the performance of the trained machine learning models. All machine learning models were trained using the built-in commands available in Matlab with default settings. Table 1 presents the corresponding hyperparameters employed in the study. Table 1: Hyperparameters for the corresponding machine learning models Model Optimal values/functions SVM Linear Kernel\n\n## KNN K = 115\n\nDistance metric = Euclidean (Continued)\n\n\n\n---\n\nJCS, 2023, vol.5 41 Table 1 (continued) Model Optimal values/functions Decision tree Maximum splits = 242 Blending model: SVM RBF Kernel\n\n## KNN K = 115\n\nDT Maximum splits = 160 AdaBoost Number of decision stump = 100 Penalty factor = 2 4 Results and Discussions\n\n## 4.1 SVM\n\nThe testing of the trained SVM model produced an average accuracy exceeding 96%, which is generally deemed acceptable for classification models. However, relying solely on accuracy as a performance indicator can be misleading. Therefore, various attributes have been computed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance. Based on the result, the SVM model demonstrates satisfactory performance, with an accuracy of 99.17%, recall of 92%, F1-score of 96%, and an AUC of 96%. A scatter plot of the test data is shown in Fig. 3, demonstrating how non-fraud data are clustered close to each other, while the fraudulent ones appear to be distinctively separated. The scatter plot also highlights two misclassifications of fraudulent data. This suggests that the high accuracy observed is likely not solely due to overfitting but rather because of accurate classification of non-fraudulent transactions. Since all transaction data from the original dataset were tested, the high accuracy is indicative of correct classifications for these cases. Figure 3: Scattered 2D plot of the test data using SVM machine\n\n\n\n---\n\n42 JCS, 2023, vol.5\n\n## 4.2 KNN\n\nThe KNN model exhibits accuracy above 90%, indicating acceptable predictive capabilities. However, as accuracy alone is insufficient for assessing the classifier performance, especially for imbalanced datasets, other metrics were considered. Calculating true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) led to precision, recall, and F1-score calculations. In the case of KNN classifier, these metrics provide insights into its performance, particularly in handling imbalanced datasets. The F1-score and AUC values of 83% and 88.8%, respectively, support the KNN model’s solid performance. Nevertheless, the relatively lower recall at 78% suggests that the KNN model may have a slightly higher specificity in classifying false positive data compared to true positive transactions. 4.3 Decision Tree The decision tree model demonstrates an impressive accuracy of 99.92%, implying its capability to make highly accurate predictions. Precision stands at 0.74, recall at 0.82, and the F1-score at 0.78, indicating a well-balanced performance between precision and recall. The AUC for the decision tree model is 0.91, suggesting its effectiveness in distinguishing true fraudulent transactions. However, it is important to note that metrics other than accuracy are significantly lower. This suggests that the decision tree model may misclassify normal transactions as frauds, as indicated by the lower recall and AUC values. Overall, the model adeptly detects fraudulent transactions but may require tuning to address potential misclassifications. 4.4 Blending The blending model achieves an accuracy of 99.963%, but, as discussed previously, accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets. Therefore, other evaluation metrics like recall, F1-score, and AUC were considered for a more comprehensive assessment. Based on the results, the blending model records values of 81%, 88% and 90.50% for recall, F1- score, and AUC, respectively. High recall suggests the model’s effectiveness in correctly identifying positive instances (credit card fraud cases) from the entire pool of actual positives in the dataset. Similarly, a high F1-score indicates a good balance between precision and recall, signifying accurate classification of both positive and negative instances. Nevertheless, the considerably higher accuracy compared to the other metrics suggests the model may misclassify normal transactions as fraud. Overall, the F1-score and AUC of the blending model are more consistent and closely aligned. The model attains the highest accuracy while maintaining balanced values for recall, F1-score, and AUC, outperforming the individual models (SVM, KNN, DT). This improvement can be attributed to the blending model’s ability to leverage information from the base models. By combining outputs and feeding them to the meta-learner (logistic regression), the blending model effectively harnesses the strengths of each base model, resulting in enhanced predictive capabilities. 4.5 AdaBoost Following training and testing, the AdaBoost model is evaluated with the discussed metrics. Results show an accuracy (AC) of 99.90%, recall (RC) of 72.28%, F1-score of 73.37%, and AUC of 86.12%. While the model attains high accuracy, its performance in recall and F1-score is relatively lower.\n\n\n\n---\n\nJCS, 2023, vol.5 43 The imbalanced dataset, where the majority class comprises non-fraudulent transactions and the minority class represents about 0.179% of the data as fraudulent transactions, explains the performance gap. The AdaBoost model may not perform well in classifying fraudulent results as a whole due to the lower score of recall and F1-score. 4.6 Comparison between Individual, Stacking and Boosting Models This section aims to determine the most effective model for credit card fraud detection by comparing the performances of all the models examined in this study. Table 2 provides the detailed performance results for each model. Table 2: Comparison results of the machine learning models in classification of fraudulent transactions Model AC RC F1-score AUC SVM 0.9917 0.9200 0.9600 0.9610 KNN 0.9994 0.7800 0.8300 0.8880 Decision tree 0.9992 0.8200 0.7800 0.9110 Blending model 0.9996 0.8100 0.8800 0.9050 AdaBoost 0.9990 0.7228 0.7337 0.8612 AllKNN-CatBoost [1] 0.9996 0.9591 0.8740 0.9794 GA-Decision tree (v1) [4] 0.9992 0.7522 0.7522 – Logistic regression (25:75) [6] 0.9590 0.8390 0.9090 0.9180 As depicted in Table 2, it is evident that SVM achieved the highest scores across all evaluation metrics except for accuracy. On the other hand, the blending model stands out with the highest accuracy of 99.96%. Nevertheless, as discussed earlier, accuracy might not be the most dependable metric for imbalanced datasets. Hence, a comprehensive assessment considering RC, F1-score, and AUC becomes crucial to evaluate the model performance. Ensemble models, including the blending model and AdaBoost, did not achieve particularly high values for recall and F1-score when compared to individual machine learning models such as SVM, KNN, and the decision tree. This discrepancy can be attributed to the distinct approaches employed by these models. SVM aims to identify a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between classes, essentially classifying the fraudulent status of transactions based on their proximity to this boundary. In contrast, ensemble models seek to capture patterns from both majority and minority classes by adjusting weights and combining features from individual component models. While acknowledging the dataset’s inherent imbalance, we chose not to employ sampling techniques to address this issue. This decision stems from the potential pitfalls of such techniques. Under-sampling may lead to underfitting as critical information is lost due to dataset reduction, while over-sampling can result in overfitting as the model memorizes minority class instances, leading to poor generalization to new data. Instead, we opted to work with the original imbalanced dataset and devised a model that consistently performs well across various evaluation metrics. In light of the results, the SVM model emerges as the top performer across most evaluation metrics, except for accuracy. However, given the dataset’s imbalance characteristics, the high scores in recall, F1-score, and AUC raise concerns about potential overfitting during training, which might not be apparent during testing. On the other hand, the ensemble model, particularly the blending model,\n\n\n\n---\n\n44 JCS, 2023, vol.5 excels in terms of accuracy and maintains balanced values for recall, F1-score and AUC. This suggests that the blending model may be superior choice for training on imbalanced datasets, offering robust performance without overfitting or underfitting issue. Comparing our approach using SVM with previous works utilizing European datasets, our method outperforms all previous models in terms of F1-score. It achieves nearly identical accuracy compared to prior works but exhibit over a 3% improvement compared to logistic regression for detection. In terms of recall and AUC, our SVM model narrowly trails behind the AllKNN-CatBoost model by approximately 3% and 2%, respectively. In conclusion, our credit card fraud detection approach appears not only feasible but capable of achieving superior or comparable results when compared to models trained on sampled datasets. One of the primary limitations of this study is the examination of a limited number of machine learning models with default parameters, primarily due to the utilization of built-in functions. To further enhance these models, future research should focus on parameter refinement for ensemble models, the integration of additional machine learning techniques into ensemble models, and explo- ration of alternative machine learning models. Additionally, it would be valuable to test and validate these machine learning models using datasets other than the European transaction dataset to obtain more conclusive results. 5 Conclusions In conclusion, the development of an AI-based credit card fraud detection system necessitates meticulous consideration of various data preprocessing steps. These steps encompass addressing imbalanced datasets through sampling techniques, standardizing data to ensure consistent scaling, and selecting pertinent features for the model. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that in this study, sampling techniques were deliberately omitted to avoid potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The individual machine learning models employed in the work demonstrated commendable performance, with SVM emerging as the top-performing model. However, there is a notable concern regarding the potential overfitting of SVM to the data, which could impact its generalization capabilities for new data entries. Additionally, this might lead to extended training times due to processing of a larger dataset. Conversely, ensemble models, with particular emphasis on the blending model, outperformed AdaBoost. Ensemble learning showcased its strength in achieving consistently strong performance across various evaluation metrics. This underscores the potential of ensemble learning techniques in amalgamating multiple models to capture patterns from both majority and minority classes, rendering them more suitable for addressing credit card fraud detection challenges prevalent in the financial and banking industry. This study does come with certain limitations. The study was constrained by the limited number of machine learning models assessed for fraudulent transaction classification. Given the utilization of built-in functions without parameter adjustments, the trained models reported here may not be optimized for peak performance. Future research endeavours could explore the integration of alternative machine learning models, including deep learning, within the stacking model to further enhance the ensemble learning approach. Moreover, since the concern of imbalanced datasets persists, it is crucial to explore other datasets to arrive at a more comprehensive solution for fraudulent classification. In essence, this study contributes to the burgeoning field of credit card fraud detection by shedding light on the potential of ensemble machine learning models, particularly the blending model, as a promising avenue for improving accuracy and generalization in tackling the complexities of fraudulent transaction identification.\n\n\n\n---\n\nJCS, 2023, vol.5 45 Acknowledgement: We extend our gratitude to all the authors and the institution who supported this research.

Great project. I’ve analyzed the set of papers you provided and prepared a structured draft for your Pre-Dissertation report. The sections below synthesize the literature, propose a rigorous approach for your study, and give you a ready-to-edit narrative you can tailor to your exact needs.

Preface
- This report documents a systematic literature-informed plan to investigate credit card fraud detection using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, with particular attention to imbalanced data, feature selection, and automation. The goal is to establish a robust methodology for evaluating multiple algorithms on real-world and synthetic datasets, identify best practices, and propose a path toward practical, real-time fraud-detection solutions. The work draws on recent reviews and empirical studies that span traditional ML, DL, hybrid models, oversampling strategies, feature selection, AutoML, and privacy-conscious approaches such as federated learning.

Introduction
- Problem context: Credit card fraud is a persistent and costly risk in electronic payments. The literature shows fraud detection as a binary classification problem under severe class imbalance (fraudulent cases are rare compared to legitimate ones). A variety of ML/DL methods have been applied, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM, KNN, CNNs, LSTMs, and ensemble methods. Imbalance handling (oversampling/undersampling, SMOTE/ADASYN, GAN-based oversampling), feature selection (PCA, LDA, GA-based selectors), and model automation are recurrent themes that significantly influence performance and deployment practicality.
- Purpose of this work: To synthesize prevailing findings from representative papers, design a rigorous, reproducible evaluation framework, and draft the sections needed for a Pre-Dissertation report that can guide a substantial research project. The aim is to produce a comparative analysis of ML/DL models, investigate the impact of oversampling and feature selection, explore AutoML options, and discuss practicalities of deployment (real-time detection, interpretability, and privacy).
- Key takeaways guiding this work: Random Forests and other tree-based ensembles frequently achieve high accuracy on imbalanced fraud datasets; oversampling (SMOTE/ADASYN, and modern deep generative oversamplers) often improves recall of fraud cases; feature selection reduces dimensionality and can improve generalization; AutoML (e.g., Just Add Data) can automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning while maintaining competitive performance; privacy-preserving approaches (e.g., federated learning) are increasingly relevant for cross-institution collaborations.

Review of Literature (synthesis by themes)
- Datasets and problem framing
  - European cardholder datasets (e.g., 284,807 transactions with ~0.17% fraud) are widely used to benchmark ML models; these datasets are highly imbalanced and anonymized (V1–V28 features, Time, Amount). Several papers explicitly critique the reliance on resampling and study models trained on the original data or on synthetic variants to gauge robustness.
  - Real-world and app-specific datasets include Australian and other regional datasets, PaySim synthetic datasets, and Kaggle European datasets. Papers emphasize the need to test across domains to assess generalizability.
  - Key takeaway: A robust dissertation design should include multiple datasets (at least one real-world European dataset and an additional dataset from another domain or synthetic data) to test generalization and to examine how models react to distribution shifts.

- Classical ML algorithms and DL variants
  - Classical ML (LR, DT, RF, NB, SVM, kNN) remains a strong baseline. RF often yields high accuracy and robustness under imbalanced conditions; DTs offer interpretability; SVMs can perform well with proper kernel choice but may struggle with very large datasets.
  - DL approaches (CNNs, LSTMs, MLPs, autoencoders) show promise in capturing nonlinear patterns and higher-order interactions, especially when paired with feature engineering or representation learning. However, DL gains can be dataset-size dependent and sometimes come with higher training costs and interpretability challenges.
  - Key takeaway: Build a tiered evaluation: baseline classical ML + a DL baseline, then explore hybrid models and advanced DL architectures only if data size and variability justify it.

- Handling class-imbalance
  - Oversampling and data-level methods (SMOTE, ADASYN) are widely used to balance classes before modeling, often improving recall of fraud cases, but they can risk overfitting or introduce synthetic artifacts if not used carefully.
  - Deep generative oversampling (GANs, VAEs and their hybrids like GANSO, MoGAN, 3D-HyperGAMO, etc.) promises more realistic minority-class samples but introduces training complexity and potential instability.
  - Cost-sensitive learning and ensemble methods are common alternatives that help address imbalance without excessive reliance on synthetic samples.
  - Key takeaway: Plan to compare traditional oversampling (SMOTE/ADASYN) with modern deep generative oversampling, plus no-oversampling baselines, and report multiple metrics beyond accuracy (AUC/ROC, F1, recall, precision).

- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
  - Feature selection (LDA, PCA, GA-based feature selection, wrapper/embedded methods) is repeatedly shown to improve learning efficiency and sometimes accuracy by removing noisy or redundant features.
  - GA-based feature selection combined with RF or other classifiers has shown promising results in fraud detection datasets.
  - Key takeaway: Include a dedicated feature-selection stage in your methodology, and compare performance with and without feature selection.

- AutoML and model automation
  - AutoML systems (e.g., Just Add Data) automate algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance estimation, offering competitive results and interpretability support. They also facilitate rapid experimentation and reproducibility, which is especially valuable in fraud-detection studies with many model variants.
  - Key takeaway: Consider including an AutoML component as one branch of the evaluation to quantify its competitiveness against hand-tuned baselines.

- Privacy, deployment and real-time considerations
  - Privacy-preserving approaches (federated learning) are discussed as a pathway to training fraud-detection models across institutions without exchanging raw data.
  For real-time detection, latency and streaming capability become critical; simple, heavily-engineered pipelines can outperform more complex models in production environments.

Research Methodology (your plan)
- Research questions (example)
  1) Which ML/DL models deliver the strongest fraud-detection performance on imbalanced European credit-card datasets, and how do they compare when augmented by different balancing and feature-selection strategies?
  2) How does feature selection (e.g., LDA, PCA, GA-based selectors) impact model performance and interpretability?
  3) What is the added value (if any) of AutoML in this domain, compared to best-tuned manually engineered models?
  4) How robust are models to distribution shifts across datasets (European vs. Australian vs. synthetic PaySim-like data)?
  5) What are practical deployment considerations (latency, explainability, privacy) for production fraud detection?

- Data sources (at least two datasets)
  - European credit card dataset (the standard 30 features V1–V28, Time, Amount; fraud label). Use the original data with preprocessing as a baseline, and also consider a SMOTE/ADASYN-augmented version for comparison.
  - An additional dataset to test generalization, e.g. Australian credit dataset, or PaySim synthetic data, or a non-European real-world dataset if available.
  - Optional: a small, privacy-preserving cross-institution scenario (fictional) to discuss federated learning considerations.

- Experimental design
  - Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and a simple Neural Network (MLP) as a DL baseline.
  - Feature handling: Standardize features; analyze PCA/LDA as placement options; experiment with GA-based feature selection (as a wrapper around model training).
  - Balancing strategies: 
    - No resampling (baseline on original data)
    - Classic oversampling (SMOTE, ADASYN)
    - Deep generative oversampling (GAN/VAEs-based approaches such as GANSO, MoGAN, 3D-HyperGAMO, and related hybrids)
    - Undersampling methods as a complement for comparison (careful handling to avoid loss of information)
  - Model optimization:
    - Hyperparameter tuning for each model (regularization, tree depth, learning rate, number of trees, kernel parameters, etc.)
    - AutoML branch to compare performance and interpretability against hand-tuned baselines
  - Evaluation metrics:
    - Primary: AUC/ROC, F1-score, recall (fraud detection emphasis), precision
    - Secondary: Accuracy, PR-AUC, MCC, calibration metrics
    - Computational metrics: training time, inference latency (for real-time considerations)
  - Validation strategy: 
    - Stratified k-fold cross-validation for robust estimates
    - Holdout test set for final evaluation
    - Statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests or non-parametric tests) to compare top models
  - Reproducibility: Document seeds, data preprocessing steps, and exact hyperparameters; consider releasing code and configuration files.

- Data analysis plan
  - Compare performance across models and balancing strategies using aggregated metrics (mean and 95% CIs) over cross-validation folds.
  - Analyze feature importance and model explainability (SHAP values or feature-importance plots for tree ensembles; LIME for select models).
  - Investigate the impact of feature selection by comparing performance with and without FS, and by analyzing the most informative features across models.
  - Evaluate robustness to distribution shifts by testing models trained on European data on the second dataset without retraining, then with retraining.

- Deliverables
  - A comprehensive experimental report detailing methodology, results, and interpretations.
  - Clear figures and tables showing model performance across configurations.
  - An Abbreviations section and a Findings/Recommendations section suitable for the dissertation narrative.

- Tools and environment (suggested)
  - Python-based ML stack (scikit-learn for baseline models; XGBoost or LightGBM for gradient-boosted trees; TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for DL baselines; imbalanced-learn for SMOTE/ADASYN).
  - AutoML option (e.g., a JAD-like tool or other AutoML frameworks) as a comparative branch.
  - Data visualization: matplotlib/seaborn for performance plots; SHAP for interpretability.
  - Reproducibility: Jupyter/Notebook pipelines with requirements.txt; a reproducible workflow (e.g., Makefile or a simple Python script with config files).

Data Analysis and Interpretation (how you’ll present results)
- Tables and figures
  - Model-by-model performance table: model, balancing strategy, FS method (if any), AUC, F1, recall, precision, MCC, training time.
  - ROC curves and precision-recall curves for top-performing models.
  - Feature-importance charts for tree-based models; SHAP summary plots for interpretability.
  - Cross-dataset generalization results: how models trained on European data perform on the second dataset, with notes on the need for retraining vs. fine-tuning.
- Discussion points
  - Which models consistently perform well across datasets and balancing methods?
  - Does feature selection consistently improve generalization and interpretability?
  - Do AutoML results keep pace with manually tuned top performers?
  - What are the trade-offs between accuracy and latency for potential real-time deployment?
  - How robust are the results to distribution shifts and data-scarcity scenarios?

Findings, Recommendations and Conclusion (template narrative)
- Findings
  - Tree ensembles (especially Random Forests) often achieve high accuracy and robust performance on imbalanced fraud datasets.
  - Oversampling techniques (SMOTE/ADASYN) tend to improve recall for fraudulent transactions, but require careful parameterization to avoid overfitting or information leakage.
  - Deep generative oversampling shows promise for improving minority-class coverage but introduces complexity and potential stability issues; benefits appear dataset-dependent.
  - Feature selection typically reduces dimensionality and improves learning efficiency; the best-performing feature subsets vary by dataset and model, underscoring the value of a guided FS approach.
  - AutoML can reach competitive performance with reduced manual tuning and can help with reproducibility; however, interpretability and custom feature engineering remain important considerations.
- Recommendations
  - Adopt a multi-model evaluation framework combining baseline ML, strong ensembling, and a selective DL component to capture nonlinear patterns without overcomplicating deployment.
  - Use a balanced mix of oversampling methods (start with SMOTE/ADASYN; experiment with GAN/VAE-based oversampling in parallel) and include models trained on original data to gauge true gains.
  - Integrate feature selection as a standard pipeline step, testing both filter/embedded methods and wrapper-based approaches.
  - Consider AutoML as a complementary tool, but maintain the ability to interpret and explain top models, especially for regulatory or business stakeholders.
  - If privacy and cross-institution collaboration are priorities, prototype a federated-learning discussion or design to explore privacy-preserving learning in future work.
- Conclusion
  - The literature converges on a core insight: combining robust ML/DL models with careful handling of imbalance and thoughtful feature selection yields strong fraud-detection performance, with practical deployment considerations (latency, interpretability, privacy) guiding the choice of methods.
  - Your dissertation can contribute by providing a transparent, multi-dataset, multi-method evaluation framework, a nuanced analysis of FS and oversampling choices, and a pragmatic discussion of AutoML and privacy-preserving avenues for real-world adoption.

Future Scope
- Extensions to real-time and streaming fraud detection with low latency, including edge inference and online learning.
- Deeper exploration of deep generative oversampling in varied domains and under different imbalance regimes, with robust evaluation of diversity and realism of synthetic samples.
- AutoML-driven experiment replication across more diverse datasets and more complex feature spaces, with careful emphasis on explainability outputs.
- Privacy-preserving and federated learning approaches to enable cross-institution fraud detection without sharing raw data; benchmark privacy-utility trade-offs.
- Explainable AI (XAI) enhancements to improve stakeholder trust and regulatory compliance, including visual explanations of decisions and feature contributions.
- Cross-domain generalization studies to assess how well fraud-detection models trained on one country's data transfer to another country’s data and what adaptations are necessary.
